#
#This file is used as an input for org.jgroups.tests.perf.PerformanceTestGenerator 
#utility. PerformanceTestGenerator, given this input file with -config flag,  then 
#in turn generates test files that are used in conjunction with 
#bin/clusterperfromancetest.sh. The number of test files generated is 
#number_of_senders*message_sizes. Each test file represents one performance 
#round. In each performance round JGroups cluster is formed and tests are 
#executed using org.jgroups.tests.perf.Test utility.
#
#Configuration parameters are:
#
# - nodes: number of group member nodes (machines) used in the performance test
# - total_data: total size of data in bytes
# - number_of_sender: specifies how many nodes will be senders in each test 
# - message_sizes: specifies message size used in each test
# - log_data_points: specifies how many log points will be captured in test output
#
#

#Number of machines used for performance tests. This value should match number 
#of computer nodes listed in CLUSTER_NODES variable of bin/clusterperformancetests.sh
nodes=8

#Total combined amount of data in bytes sent by all senders in a perfromance test round

#Number of senders in each performance round

#Message size in bytes for each performance round
