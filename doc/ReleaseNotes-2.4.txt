JGroups 2.4 is a backward compatible release, that is it can replace previous versions (2.3 - 2.2.7) by simply replacing
the JGroups JAR file. The new features are described below.



FLUSH protocol
--------------
This essentially adds another virtual synchrony implementation for JGroups (the old one being vsync.xml), however it
is based on the default stack which has been used for quite a while now, and which is well tested.
FLUSH is required when we have multiple services sitting on the same Multiplexer, and more than 1 of them requires
state transfer (for an explanation see JGroups/doc/design/PartialStateTransfer.txt).


Partial state transfer
----------------------
Sometimes an application doesn't want to transfer the entire state, but just a subset. Example: JBossCache in JBoss,
where we may want to transfer just a subtree, not the entire tree.


Streaming state transfer
------------------------
When we need to transfer large state, the existing state transfer requires an application programmer to provide the
state as a byte[] buffer. If the state is large, or needs to be retrieved by traversing a tree structure (e.g.
a DOM tree), then providing a byte[] buffer may not make much sense.
Streaming state transfer provides an InputStream to read state and an OutputStream to write state, and transfer the
written bytes in *chunks*, so that the memory requirements are smaller. Example: if we have a huge DOM tree, whose
aggregate size is 2GB (and which has partly been passivated to disk), then the state provider (ie. the coordinator) can
simply iterate over the DOM tree (activating the parts which have been passivated out to disk), and writing to the
OutputStream as he traverses the tree. The receiver will simply read from the InputStream and reconstruct the tree
on his side, possibly again passivating parts to disk. Rather than having to provide a 2GB byte[] buffer (besides the
state, so the needed memory is ca 4GB temporarily), streaming state transfer transfers the state in chunks of N bytes
(user configurable).
Check out the documentation for details and sample code.


View bundling
-------------
When we have many concurrent JOINS, LEAVES or SUSPECTs, then we emit a view for each and every one of them. Say we have
20 JOINs, then we will have 20 views. With view bundling, we can reduce this by simply handling multiple
JOIN/LEAVE/SUSPECT requests together as one. This might generate 5 views rather than 20 (config-dependent).


Failure detection: FD_PING
--------------------------
This allows to run a script to probe for liveness of a host. Default is /sbin/ping (ping.exe on Windows). Can be used
in addition with FD_SOCK/FD.


Failure detection: FD_ICMP
--------------------------
Uses InetAddress.isReachable() to determine whether a given host is reachable. Note that this may or may not use
ICMP pings, depending on the JDK implementation. Can be used in conjunction with FD_SOCK/FD/FD_PING.


Performance measurements
------------------------
Performed on 4, 6 and 8 node clusters. Results are available at http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/perf/Report.html.


Use of variables in configuration files
---------------------------------------
Variables of type ${var:default} or ${var} can now be used in configuration files (both XML and plain text).
They will get replaced by the result of System.getProperty(var, default). If no system property is set, the
variables will not get substituted. Note that variables and default values cannot contains characters '{', '}' or ':'.


User-defined Marshaller is now used for return values too
---------------------------------------------------------
Before, a user defined Marshaller in RpcDispatcher was only used for marshalling of a request at the caller and
unmarshalling of the request at the receiver, but not for marshalling the response at the receiver and
unmarshalling the response at the caller. In the latter 2 cases, Util.objectTo/FromByteBuffer() was used.
Now, in all 4 cases, the Marshaller will be used (if set).


Optmization in Util.objectTo/FromByteBuffer()
---------------------------------------------
We don't create an ObjectInput/OutputStream for null values and simple primitive types.


Incompatibilities to previous version
-------------------------------------
- ExtendedMessageListener: we added 4 methods, so if you used ExtendedReceiverAdapter you're fine. Otherwise you will
  have to recompile. Note that this does *not* affect just linking against JGroups, so if you simply replace your
  jgroups.jar, you're fine


Enhancements and bug fixes
--------------------------
- COMPRESS now uses multiple deflaters/inflaters, this results in more concurrent compression, more performance
- Multiplexer: few bug fixes (detected by integrating into JBoss), there are now 2 new unit tests that cover the bugs fixed
- Bug fix for VIEW_SYNC after network partition and subsequent merge (http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-217)
- DistributedLockManager now releases locks leftover by a crashed process


Documentation
