Latency versus throughput
=========================
Author: Bela Ban
Date:   Feb 2023


JGroups can be configured to reduce latency (e.g. for synchronous RPCs), or to provide high throughput (e.g. for
asynchronous sending of messages). The default configuration is tuned for *high throughput*.

Unfortunately, there is no middle ground configuration which provides both low latency *and* high throughput.

The goal of this work is to come up with recommendations and sample configurations which provide *low latency*.
This includes
* Configuration changes
* Code changes / additions (e.g. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JGRP-2672)
* Best practices for applications to help in the reduction of latency. E.g. OOB versus regular messages, batch
  processing etc



Components to look at
---------------------

* Bundler type (TransferQueue, NoBundler, PerDestinationBundler)
  * Does the message submitted to the bundler cause the current thread to possibly send it? Or are messages added
    to a queue from where a different thread sends it?

* Thread pool enabled/disabled

* JDK: virtual threads available?

* Many threads sending messages / few threads sending messages?
  * Oversubscription: more threads than cores? -> Virtual threads

* OOB or regular messages (FIFO delivery per sender needed)?
  * DONT_BUNDLE flag set?

* Unicast or multicast messages?

* Transport: TCP, TCP_NIO2 or UDP?

* TCP: output/input stream buffering? (TCP.buffered_{output,input}_stream_size)

* BATCH{2}: batching on the sender side (many small requests), with or without batching in the bundler



Recommendations
---------------

* General
  * Use a JDK >= 15. Changes to the networking code in 15 improved performance for TCP (and UDP datagram sockets)
    a lot: http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html
  * Use virtual threads (set use_virtual_threads=true in the transport). This reduces context switching when more
    threads than cores are used.
  * Remove TIME when up/down measurements are not needed anymore; every message sent/received requires a
    System.nanoTime(), slowing things down a bit

* TCP:
  * Low latency:
    * buffered_output_stream_size=0 (or a low value)
    * bundler_type="no-bundler"
      * Investigate: use "per-destination" bunder_type, but also use OOB|DONT_BUNDLE

  * High throughput: set buffered_output_stream to a high value (e.g. 65k)


* UNICAST3
  * ack_threshold: <investigate>

Discussion
----------

* OOB versus regular messages on the receiver side
