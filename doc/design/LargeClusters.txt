ConcurrentHashMap
-----------------

CCHMs have a default initial capacity (16), load factor (0.75) and concurrency level (16). These are OK for most
scenarios, but we have to investigate whether these values are sufficient for 1000 node clusters.

When for example 1000 threads from different senders access the same CCHM, we need to make sure we don't have high
contention, ie. by spreading a 1000 senders over 16 buckets.

Investigate whether we should add CCHM initial sizes, load factors and concurrency levels as properties.

With ergonomics [1], we could for example set bucket sizes for CCHMs dynamically, e.g. based on cluster size.

Misc
----

- MERGE2: num_initial_members in Discovery should be large, so that we detect partitions sooner
- GMS: view bundling should be enabled, and max_bundling_time should be a bit larger than the default, as this
  will allow for more concurrent joins and leaves before starting the view installation process
