receive() needs to consume the buffer
-------------------------------------
The receive(Message msg) callback needs to consume the buffer of msg, as the transport might reuse the buffer and thus
overwrite its contents. Consuming means for example to de-serialize the buffer into an application object.
If the application needs to hang on to the buffer, it needs to make a *copy*.
