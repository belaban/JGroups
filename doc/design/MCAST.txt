MCAST
=====

Contrary to NAKACK2, MCAST does not dynamically expand or shrink its xmit window, but instead uses a fixed size
xmit window (RingBufferSeqno). This means that flow control is built in, and MFC is not required anymore.

An xmit window has a low and high index, with the following semantics:
* On the sender: low = highest acked, high = highest sent seqno
* On the receiver: low = highest delivered, high = highest received seqno

Seqnos are mapped to an index in the ring buffer.

A sender blocks sending a message when no space is available in the window, while a receiver drops the message.

Receivers ack delivered messages, either periodically (xmit_interval), or after delivery of N messages.

When a sender has received acks from all receivers (cluster members), it computes minimum M and purges all messages
lower than M. This may unblock sender threads waiting for space to add their messages.

Every member periodically (xmit_interval) checks its receiver tables, and asks senders for missing messages.


Fields
------
- capacity: number of messages in the xmit window
- xmit-table: map of member|RingBufferSeqno tuples
- send-window: xmit-table.get(local-addr)
- seqno
- ack-map: map of highest ack from each member


Design
------

On sending of message M
-----------------------
- The sender increments seqno to get a new seqno S and attaches S to M
- M is then added to send-window:
  - If S - low >= capacity -> block the sender (no space)
  - Else:
      - Add M
      - high=max(high,S)
      - Send M

On reception of message M
-------------------------
- Find receiver window rwin for the given sender
- Add M to rwin:
  - If M < low or >= low+capacity: drop, added=false
  - Else:
    - If M was already received -> added=false
    - Else added=true, high=max(high,M)
- If added:
  - Remove and deliver messages from rwin until a gap is encountered, incr low for every removed message
  - Send an ACK for the highest removed message back to the sender
    (could be scheduled to be sent on xmit-interval, or sent only when N messages have been removed)


On reception of ACK from member P
---------------------------------
- Set ack-map[P]=max(ack-map[P],ACK)
- If min(ack-map) > prev min:
  - send-window.purge(min): this advances the low index, possibly unblocking blocked sender threads


Every xmit_interval
-------------------
- For each receiver window rwin:
  - Find missing messages in rwin and send an XMIT-REQ to the sender


On reception of XMIT-REQ from P
-------------------------------
- Find message M for the XMIT-REQ
- Send M to P (as multicast, or wrapped unicast)


On reception of view V
----------------------
- Remove receiver windows of non-members
- Create new receiver windows for new members


On reception of digest D:
-------------------------
- For all new members P -> create receiver window with offset=D[P]
