Design of RACKSPACE_PING
========================

Author: Gustavo Fernandes


Goal
----

RACKSPACE_PING is a discovery protocol which persist files in Rackspace Cloud Files Service

http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud-hosting/cloud-products/cloud-files/


Usage
-----

It's necessary to provide 3 properties in order to authenticate and use the service:

 * username: the Rackspace's account login
 * apiKey: the Rackspace API key associated with the account
 * region: either UK or US, the current existing rackspace locations


Design
------

As it happens with FILE_PING, this protocol also creates a root folder, also known as container in Rackspace terminology.
PingData is stored as objects, the equivalent of a file in Rackspace, but since there's no support for true hierarchical
folders, the file names also contains the path. An example of a cluster structure in Rackspace would be:

- jgroups
    - ChatCluster/e215bbe0-778c-dd28-f27b-0211619ddb2d
    - ChatCluster/b6d7bd8d-c054-2346-55a2-a0a37df6c443


Where 'jgroups' is the root container and each of the children are files belonging to the 'ChatCluster' channel.

Communication with Rackspace is done via an internal ReST client. The client authenticates with RackSpace and obtain an
auth token and an assigned URL used to do all subsequent file related operations. When the auth token expires after 24h,
the client automatically obtain a new token.

When a node leaves the channel, a shutdown hook is in place to delete the associated ping data.
