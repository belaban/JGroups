API changes in 3.0.0
====================

- Old and deprecated system properties such as bind.address (instead of jgroups.bind_addr) have been removed

- Removed package org.jgroups.persistence and changed dependent demos accordingly (e.g. ReplicatedHashMap)

- Removed all options except for Channel.LOCAL
- Removed JChannel.getOpt()/setOpt()
- Discarding of own messages can now be set via setDiscardOwnMessages(true)

- Removed package org.jgroups.mux (e.g. Multiplexer and MuxChannel). Use a shared transport instead. If you have to,
  use classes from package org.jgroups.blocks.mux (only if you're an expert though !)

- Removed (J)ChannelFactory. Inject the channel yourself, e.g. through CDI

- Removed JChannel.receive(). Use a Receiver or ReceiverAdapter and JChannel.setReceiver(Receiver) to switch from a
  pull based approach of receiving messages to a push-based approach

- Removed JChannel.receive(), peek(), shutdown(), open(), returnState(), getAllStates(), blockOK()

- Removed DistributedQueue

- Removed PullPushAdapter. Use a Receiver to get callbacks on messages, views etc

- Removed DistributedLockManager. Use LockService as replacement

- Removed NotificationBus. Use a normal JChannel as replacement

- Removed deprecated methods in MessageDispatcher and RpcDispatcher

- Removed JChannel.getLocalAddress(). Use JChannel.getAddress() instead

- Removed deprecated methods and classes

- Streamable: DataInputStream --> DataInput, DataOutputStream --> DataOutput

- RpcDispatcher: merged Marshaller and Marshaller2 into Marshaller interface

- Removed partial state transfer (nobody ever used it !)

- Removed ExtendedXXXAdapters: there is only Receiver, ReceiverAdapter, MessageListener and MembershipListener
- Moved ExtendedMembershipListener.unblock() into MembershipListener, removed ExtendedMembershipListener

- Changed Request.GET_ALL/GET_FIRST/GET_NONE etc from an int to ResponseMode.GET_ALL etc

- Removed ProtocolTester (use SHARED_LOOPBACK instead)

- Removed Address.isMulticastAddress(): a null address is a multicast address

- Rsp, RspList, RpcDispatcher.callRemoteMethodsXXX() and MessageDispatcher.cast/sendXXX() methods now use
  generics, so the code below:

  RspList rsps=disp.callRemoteMethods(null, call, new RequestOptions(ResponseMode.GET_ALL, 5000));
  for(Map.Entry<Address,Rsp> rsp: rsps.entrySet())
      System.out.println(rsp.getKey() + ": " + rsp.getValue().getValue());

  has to be changed to:

  RspList<Date> rsps=disp.callRemoteMethods(null, call, new RequestOptions(ResponseMode.GET_ALL, 5000));
  for(Map.Entry<Address,Rsp<Date>> rsp: rsps.entrySet())
      System.out.println(rsp.getKey() + ": " + rsp.getValue().getValue());

- RpcDispatcher.callRemoteMethod() now throws an exception if the target method threw an exception

- RpcDispatcher.callRemoteMethods() return a RspList. If a member P threw an exception, then the Rsp for
  P will have it in the field 'exception'. The 'result' field is *not* used for exceptions any longer !

  An example to check for exceptions is:


  Multicast:

  RspList<Long> rsps=dispatcher.callRemoteMethods(null, "foo", null, null, new RequestOptions(...));
  for(Rsp<Long> rsp: rsps.values) {
     if(rsp.getException() != null) {
         // we have an exception
     }
     else {
         Long val=rsp.getValue();
         // do something with the value
     }
  }

  Unicast:

  try {
     Rsp<Long> rsp=disp.callRemoteMethod(target, "foo", null, null, new RequestOptions(...));
     Long val=rsp.getValue();
     // do something with the return value
  }
  catch(Throwable t) {
     // "foo" threw an exception
  }
