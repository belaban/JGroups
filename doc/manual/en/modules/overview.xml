    <para>
        Group communication uses the terms <emphasis>group</emphasis> and <emphasis>member</emphasis>. Members are part
        of a group. In the more common terminology, a member is a <emphasis>node</emphasis> and a groups is a
        <emphasis>cluster</emphasis>. We use these words interchangeably.
    </para>
    <para>
        A node is a process, residing on some host. A cluster can have one or more nodes belonging to it. There
        can be multiple nodes on the same host, and all may or may not be part of the same cluster.
    </para>

  <para>JGroups is toolkit for reliable group
  communication. Processes can join a group, send messages to all
  members or single members and receive messages from members in the
  group. The system keeps track of the members in every group, and
  notifies group members when a new member joins, or an existing
  member leaves or crashes. A group is identified by its name. Groups
  do not have to be created explicitly; when a process joins a
  non-existing group, that group will be created automatically. Member
  processes of a group can be located on the same host, within the
  same LAN, or across a WAN. A member can be part of multiple
  groups.</para>

  <para>The architecture of JGroups is shown in <xref

  <para>It consists of 3 parts: (1) the Channel API used by
  application programmers to build reliable group communication
  applications, (2) the building blocks, which are layered on top of
  the channel and provide a higher abstraction level and (3) the
  protocol stack, which implements the properties specified for a
  given channel.</para>

  <para>This document describes how to install and
  <emphasis>use</emphasis> JGroups, ie. the Channel API and the
  building blocks. The targeted audience is application programmers
  who want to use JGroups to build reliable distributed programs
  that need group communication. Programmers who want to
  <emphasis>implement</emphasis> their own protocols to be used with
  JGroups should consult the Programmer's Guide for more details
  about the architecture and implementation of JGroups.</para>

  <para>A channel is connected to a protocol stack. Whenever the
  application sends a message, the channel passes it on to the
  protocol stack, which passes it to the topmost protocol. The
  protocol processes the message and the passes it on to the protocol
  below it. Thus the message is handed from protocol to protocol until
  the bottom protocol puts it on the network. The same happens in the
  reverse direction: the bottom (transport) protocol listens for
  messages on the network. When a message is received it will be
  handed up the protocol stack until it reaches the channel. The
  channel stores the message in a queue until the application consumes
  it.</para>

  <para>When an application connects to the channel, the protocol
  stack will be started, and when it disconnects the stack will be
  stopped. When the channel is closed, the stack will be destroyed,
  releasing its resources.</para>

  <para>The following three sections give an overview of channels,
  building blocks and the protocol stack.</para>


  <section><title>Channel</title>

    <para>To join a group and send messages, a process has to create a
    <emphasis>channel</emphasis> and connect to it using the group
    name (all channels with the same name form a group). The channel
    is the handle to the group. While connected, a member may send and
    receive messages to/from all other group members. The client
    leaves a group by disconnecting from the channel. A channel can be
    reused: clients can connect to it again after having
    disconnected. However, a channel allows only 1 client to be
    connected at a time. If multiple groups are to be joined, multiple
    channels can be created and connected to. A client signals that it
    no longer wants to use a channel by closing it. After this
    operation, the channel cannot be used any longer.</para>

    <para>Each channel has a unique address. Channels always know who
    the other members are in the same group: a list of member
    addresses can be retrieved from any channel. This list is called a
    <emphasis>view</emphasis>. A process can select an address from
    this list and send a unicast message to it (also to itself), or it
    may send a multicast message to all members of the current
    view. Whenever a process joins or leaves a group, or when a
    crashed process has been detected, a new <emphasis>view</emphasis>
    is sent to all remaining group members. When a member process is
    suspected of having crashed, a <emphasis>suspicion
    message</emphasis> is received by all non-faulty members. Thus,
    channels receive regular messages, view messages and suspicion
    messages. A client may choose to turn reception of views and
    suspicions on/off on a channel basis.</para>

    <para>Channels are similar to BSD sockets: messages are stored in
    a channel until a client removes the next one
    (pull-principle). When no message is currently available, a client
    is blocked until the next available message has been
    received.</para>

    <para>
        There is currently only one implementation of Channel: JChannel.
    </para>

    <para>
        The properties of a channel are typically defined in an XML file, but JGroups also allows for configuration
        through simple strings, URIs, DOM trees or even programming.
    </para>
  
    <para>The Channel API and its related classes is described in
    <xref linkend="user-channel"/>.</para>

  <section><title>Building Blocks</title>
    
    <para>Channels are simple and primitive. They offer the bare
    functionality of group communication, and have on purpose been
    designed after the simple model of BSD sockets, which are widely
    used and well understood. The reason is that an application can
    make use of just this small subset of JGroups, without having
    to include a whole set of sophisticated classes, that it may not
    even need. Also, a somewhat minimalistic interface is simple to
    understand: a client needs to know about 12 methods to be able to
    create and use a channel (and oftentimes will only use 3-4 methods
    frequently).</para>

    <para>Channels provide asynchronous message sending/reception,
    somewhat similar to UDP. A message sent is essentially put on the
    network and the send() method will return immediately. Conceptual
    <emphasis>requests</emphasis>, or <emphasis>responses</emphasis>
    to previous requests, are received in undefined order, and the
    application has to take care of matching responses with
    requests.</para>

    <para>Also, an application has to actively
    <emphasis>retrieve</emphasis> messages from a channel (pull-style);
    it is not notified when a message has been received. Note that
    pull-style message reception often needs another thread of
    execution, or some form of event-loop, in which a channel is
    periodically polled for messages.</para>

    <para>JGroups offers building blocks that provide more
    sophisticated APIs on top of a Channel. Building blocks either
    create and use channels internally, or require an existing channel
    to be specified when creating a building block. Applications
    communicate directly with the building block, rather than the
    channel. Building blocks are intended to save the application
    programmer from having to write tedious and recurring code,
    e.g. request-response correlation.</para>

    <para>Building blocks are described in <xref
    linkend="user-building-blocks"/>.</para>

  </section>

  <section><title>The Protocol Stack</title>

    <para>The protocol stack
    containins a number of protocol layers in a bidirectional
    list. All messages sent and received over the channel have to pass
    through the protocol stack. Every layer may modify, reorder, pass
    or drop a message, or add a header to a message. A fragmentation
    layer might break up a message into several smaller messages,
    adding a header with an id to each fragment, and re-assemble the
    fragments on the receiver's side.</para>

    <para>The composition of the protocol stack, i.e. its layers, is
    determined by the creator of the channel: an XML file
    defines the layers to be used (and the parameters for each
    layer). This string might be interpreted differently by each
    channel implementation; in JChannel it is used to create the
    stack, depending on the protocol names given in the
    property.</para>

    <para>Knowledge about the protocol stack is not necessary when
    only <emphasis>using</emphasis> channels in an
    application. However, when an application wishes to ignore the
    default properties for a protocol stack, and configure their own
    stack, then knowledge about what the individual layers are
    supposed to do is needed. Although it is syntactically possible to
    stack any layer on top of each other (they all have the same
    interface), this wouldn't make sense semantically in most
    cases.</para>

  </section>

  <section><title>Header</title>

    <para>
        A header is a custom bit of information that can be added to each message. JGroups uses headers extensively,
        for example to add sequence numbers to each message (NAKACK and UNICAST), so that those messages can be
        delivered in the order in which they were sent.
    </para>

  </section>

  <section><title>Event</title>

    <para>
        Events are means by which JGroups protcols can talk to each other. Contrary to Messages, which travel over the
        network between group members, events only travel up and down the stack.
