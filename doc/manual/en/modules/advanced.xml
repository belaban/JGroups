        <title>Using multiple channels</title>

        <para>
            When using a fully virtual synchronous protocol stack, the performance may not be great because of the
            larger number of protocols present. For certain applications, however, throughput is more important than
            ordering, e.g. for video/audio streams or airplane tracking. In the latter case, it is important that
            airplanes are handed over between control domains correctly, but if there are a (small) number of radar
            tracking messages (which determine the exact location of the plane) missing, it is not a problem. The first
            type of messages do not occur very often (typically a number of messages per hour), whereas the second type of
            messages would be sent at a rate of 10-30 messages/second. The same applies for a distributed whiteboard:
            messages that represent a video or audio stream have to be delivered as quick as possible, whereas messages
            that represent figures drawn on the whiteboard, or new participants joining the whiteboard have to be
            delivered according to a certain order.
        </para>

        <para>
            The requirements for such applications can be solved by using two separate channels: one for control messages
            such as group membership, floor control etc and the other one for data messages such as video/audio streams
            (actually one might consider using one channel for audio and one for video). The control channel might use
            virtual synchrony, which is relatively slow, but enforces ordering and retransmission, and the data channel
            might use a simple UDP channel, possibly including a fragmentation layer, but no retransmission layer (losing
            packets is preferred to costly retransmission).

    <section id="SharedTransport">
        <title>Sharing a transport between multiple channels in a JVM</title>

        <para>
            A transport protocol (UDP, TCP) has all the resources of a stack: the default thread pool, the OOB thread
            pool and the timer thread pool. If we run multiple channels in the same JVM, instead of creating 4
            separate stacks with a separate transport each, we can create the transport protocol as a
            <emphasis>singleton</emphasis> protocol, shared by all 4 stacks.
        </para>

        <para>
            If those transports happen to be the same (all 4 channels use UDP, for example), then we can share them and
            only create 1 instance of UDP. That transport instance is created and started only once; when the first
            channel is created, and is deleted when the last channel is closed.
        </para>

        <para>
            If we have 4 channels inside of a JVM (as is the case in an application server such as JBoss), then we
            have 12 separate thread pools (3 per transport, 4 transports). Sharing the transport reduces this to 3.
        </para>

        <para>
            Each channel created over a shared transport has to join a different cluster. An exception will be thrown
            if a channel sharing a transport tries to connect to a cluster to which another channel over the same
            transport is already connected.
        </para>

        <para>
            This is needed to multiplex and de-multiplex messages between the shared transport and the different stacks
            running over it; when we have 3 channels (C1 connected to "cluster-1", C2 connected to "cluster-2" and C3
            connected to "cluster-3") sending messages over the same shared transport, the cluster name
            with which the channel connected is used to multiplex messages over the shared transport: a header with
            the cluster name ("cluster-1") is added when C1 sends a message.
        </para>

        <para>
            When a message with a header of "cluster-1" is received by the shared transport, it is used to demultiplex
            the message and dispatch it to the right channel (C1 in this example) for processing.
        </para>

        <para>
            How channels can share a single transport is shown in <xref linkend="SharedTransportFig"/>.
        </para>

        <figure id="SharedTransportFig"><title>A shared transport</title>
            <graphic fileref="images/SharedTransport.png" format="PNG" align="center"  />
        </figure>

        <para>
            Here we see 4 channels which share 2 transports. Note that first 3 channels which share transport
            "tp_one" have the same protocols on top of the shared transport. This is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
            required; the protocols above "tp_one" could be different for each of the 3 channels as long
            as all applications residing on the same shared transport have the same requirements for the transport's
            configuration.
        </para>

        <para>
            The "tp_two" transport is used by the application on the right side.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note that the physical address of a shared channel is the same for all connected channels, so all
            applications sharing the first transport have physical address 192.168.2.5:35181.
        </para>

        <para>
            To use shared transports, all we need to do is to add a property "singleton_name" to the transport
            configuration. All channels with the same singleton name will be shared:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="XML">
&lt;UDP ...
    singleton_name="tp_one" ...
/&gt;
        </programlisting>


        <para>
            All channels using this configuration will now shared transport "tp_one". The channel on the right will
            have a different configuration, with singleton_name="tp_two".
        </para>

        <para>
            A <emphasis>transport protocol</emphasis> refers to the protocol at the bottom of the protocol stack which is
            responsible for sending messages to and receiving messages from the network. There are a number of transport
            protocols in JGroups. They are discussed in the following sections.

            <title>Message bundling</title>

            <para>
                Message bundling is beneficial when sending many small messages; it queues them until they have accumulated
                a certain size, or until a timeout has elapsed. Then, the queued messages are assembled into a larger
                message, and that message is then sent. At the receiver, the large message is disassembled and the
                smaller messages are sent up the stack.
            </para>
            <para>
                When sending many smaller messages, the ratio between payload and message headers might be small; say we
                send a "hello" string: the payload here is 7 bytes, whereas the addresses and headers (depending on the
                stack configuration) might be 30 bytes. However, if we bundle (say) 100 messages, then the payload of
                the large message is 700 bytes, but the header is still 30 bytes. Thus, we're able to send more
                actual data across the wire with one large message than many smaller ones.
            </para>
            <para>
                Message bundling is conceptually similar to TCP's Nagling algorithm.
            </para>
            <para>
                A sample configuration is shown below:
            </para>

            <programlisting language="XML">
&lt;UDP
    enable_bundling="true"
    max_bundle_size="64K"
    max_bundle_timeout="30"
/&gt;
            </programlisting>

            <para>
                Here, bundling is enabled (the default). The max accumulated size is 64'000 bytes and we wait for
                30 ms max. If at time T0, we're sending 10 smaller messages with an accumulated size of 2'000 bytes, but
                then send no more messages, then the timeout will kick in after 30 ms and the messages will get packed
                into a large message M and M will be sent. If we send 1000 messages of 100 bytes each, then - after
                exceeding 64'000 bytes (after ca. 64 messages) - we'll send the large message, and this might have taken
                only 3 ms.
            </para>

            <section id="MessageBundlingAndPerf">
                <title>Message bundling and performance</title>
                <para>
                    While message bundling is good when sending many small messages asynchronously, it can be bad when
                    invoking synchronous RPCs: say we're invoking 10 synchronous (blocking) RPCs across the cluster
                    with an RpcDispatcher (see <xref linkend="RpcDispatcher"/>), and the payload of the marshalled
                    arguments of one call is less than 64K.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Because the RPC is blocking, we'll wait until the call has returned before invoking the next RPC.
                </para>

                    For each RPC, the request takes up to 30 ms, and each response will also take up to 30 ms, for a
                    total of 60 ms <emphasis>per call</emphasis>. So the 10 blocking RPCs would take a total of 600 ms !
                </para>
                <para>
                    This is clearly not desirable. However, there's a simple solution: we can use message flags
                    (see <xref linkend="MessageFlags"/>) to override the default bundling behavior in the transport:
                </para>
                <programlisting language="Java">
RpcDispatcher disp;
RequestOptions opts=new RequestOptions(ResponseMode.GET_ALL, 5000).setFlags(Message.DONT_BUNDLE);
RspList rsp_list=disp.callRemoteMethods(null, "print", new Object[]{i}, new Class[]{int.class}, opts);

                <para>
                    The <methodname>RequestOptions.setFlags(Message.DONT_BUNDLE)</methodname> call tags the message
                    with the DONT_BUNDLE flag. When the message is to be sent by the transport, it will be sent
                    immediately, regardless of whether bundling is enabled in the transport.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Using the DONT_BUNDLE flag to invoke <methodname>print()</methodname> will take a few milliseconds

                    <para>
                        An alternative to setting the DONT_BUNDLE flag is to use futures to invoke 10 blocking RPCs:

                    <programlisting language="Java">

                <para>
                    Here we use <methodname>callRemoteMethodsWithFuture()</methodname> which (although the call
                    is blocking!) returns immediately, with a future. After invoking the 10 calls, we then grab the
                    results by fetching them from the futures.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Compared to the few milliseconds above, this will take ca 60 ms (30 for the request and 30 for
                    the responses), but this is still better than the 600 ms we get when not using the DONT_BUNDLE
                    flag. Note that, if the accumulated size of the 10 requests exceeds <literal>max_bundle_size</literal>,
                    the large message would be sent immediately, so this might even be faster than 30 ms for the request.

                    A protocol stack with UDP as transport protocol is typically used with clusters whose members run on
                    the same host or are distributed across a LAN. Note that before running instances
                    <emphasis>in different subnets</emphasis>, an admin has to make sure that IP multicast is enabled
                    across subnets. It is often the case that IP multicast is not enabled across subnets.
                    Refer to section <xref linkend="ItDoesntWork"/> for running a test program that determines whether
                    members can reach each other via IP multicast. If this does not work, the protocol stack cannot use
                    UDP with IP multicast as transport. In this case, the stack has to either use UDP without IP
                    multicasting, or use a different transport such as TCP.

                    The protocol stack with UDP and PING as the bottom protocols use IP multicasting by default to
                    send messages to all members (UDP) and for discovery of the initial members (PING). However, if
                    multicasting cannot be used, the UDP and PING protocols can be configured to send multiple unicast
                    messages instead of one multicast message

                <para>
                    If we disable ip_mcast, we now also have to change the discovery protocol (PING). Because PING

                TCP is a replacement for UDP as transport in cases where IP multicast cannot be used.

                    A protocol stack using TCP and TCPPING looks like this (other protocols omitted):

                <para>
                    The concept behind TCPPING is that some selected cluster members assume the role of well-known hosts
                    from which the initial membership information can be retrieved. In the example,
                    <parameter>HostA</parameter> and <parameter>HostB</parameter> are designated members that will be
                    used by TCPPING to lookup the initial membership. The property <parameter>bind_port</parameter>
                    in <classname>TCP</classname> means that each member should try to assign port 7800 for itself.
                    If this is not possible it will try the next higher port (<literal>7801</literal>) and so on, until
                    it finds an unused port.

                    a response, it is recommended to add all the hosts on which members of the cluster will be running

            <para>
                Firewalls are usually placed at the connection to the internet. They shield local networks from outside
                attacks by screening incoming traffic and rejecting connection attempts to host inside the firewalls by
                outside machines. Most firewall systems allow hosts inside the firewall to connect to hosts outside it
                (outgoing traffic), however, incoming traffic is most often disabled entirely.

            <para>
                <emphasis>Tunnels</emphasis> are host protocols which encapsulate other protocols by multiplexing them
                at one end and demultiplexing them at the other end. Any protocol can be tunneled by a tunnel protocol.

            <para>
                The most restrictive setups of firewalls usually disable <emphasis>all</emphasis> incoming traffic, and
                only enable a few selected ports for outgoing traffic. In the solution below, it is

            </para>

            <para>
                JGroups has a mechanism that allows a programmer to tunnel a firewall. The solution involves a

            <para>
                The solution works as follows. A channel inside a firewall has to use protocol TUNNEL instead of UDP or

                members. This connection is initiated by the host inside the firewall and persists as long as the channel
                is connected to a group. A GossipRouter will use the <emphasis>same connection</emphasis>
                to send incoming messages to the channel that initiated the connection. This is perfectly legal, as TCP
                connections are fully duplex. Note that, if GossipRouter tried to establish its own TCP connection to the
                channel behind the firewall, it would fail. But it is okay to reuse the existing TCP connection,
                established by the channel.

                Any time a message has to be sent, TUNNEL forwards the message to GossipRouter, which distributes it to
                its destination: if the message's destination field is null (send to all group members), then GossipRouter
                looks up the members that belong to that group and forwards the message to all of them via the TCP
                connections they established when connecting to GossipRouter. If the destination is a valid member address,
                then that member's TCP connection is looked up, and the message is forwarded to it
                <footnote>
                    <para>To do so, GossipRouter maintains a mapping between cluster names and member addresses, and TCP

                A GossipRouter is not a single point of failure. In a setup with multiple gossip routers, the routers do
                not communicate among themselves, and a single point of failure is avoided by having each channel simply
                connect to multiple available routers. In case one or more routers go down, the cluster members are still
                able to exchange messages through any of the remaining available router instances, if there are any.

                For each send invocation, a channel goes through a list of available connections to routers and attempts
                to send the message on each connection until it succeeds. If a message can not be sent on any of the
                connections, an exception is raised. The default policy for connection selection is random. However, we
                provide an plug-in interface for other policies as well.

                First, the GossipRouter process is created on host B. Note that host B should be outside the firewall,
                and all channels in the same group should use the same GossipRouter process. When a channel on host A is
                created, its <classname>TCPGOSSIP</classname>
                protocol will register its address with the GossipRouter and retrieve the initial membership (assume this
                is C). Now, a TCP connection with the GossipRouter is established by A; this will persist until A crashes
                or voluntarily leaves the group. When A multicasts a message to the cluster, GossipRouter looks up all cluster
                members (in this case, A and C) and forwards the message to all members, using their TCP connections. In
                the example, A would receive its own copy of the multicast message it sent, and another copy would be sent
                to C.

                , which are only allowed to connect back to the host from which they were downloaded, to use JGroups: the
                HTTP server would be located on host B and the gossip and GossipRouter daemon would also run on that host.
                An applet downloaded to either A or C would be allowed to make a TCP connection to B. Also, applications
                behind a firewall would be able to talk to each other, joining a group.
            </para>

            <para>However, there are several drawbacks: first, having to maintain a TCP connection for the duration of the
                connection might use up resources in the host system (e.g. in the GossipRouter), leading to scalability
                problems, second, this scheme is inappropriate when only a few channels are located behind firewalls, and
                the vast majority can indeed use IP multicast to communicate, and finally, it is not always possible to
                enable outgoing traffic on 2 ports in a firewall, e.g. when a user does not 'own' the firewall.

        <title>The concurrent stack</title>

        <para>
            The concurrent stack (introduced in 2.5) provides a number of improvements over previous releases,
            which has some deficiencies:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    Large number of threads: each protocol had by default 2 threads, one for the up and one for the
                    down queue. They could be disabled per protocol by setting up_thread or down_thread to false.
                    In the new model, these threads have been removed.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Sequential delivery of messages: JGroups used to have a single queue for incoming messages,
                    processed by one thread. Therefore, messages from different senders were still processed in
                    FIFO order. In 2.5 these messages can be processed in parallel.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Out-of-band messages: when an application doesn't care about the ordering properties of a message,
                    the OOB flag can be set and JGroups will deliver this particular message without regard for any
                    ordering.

            <para>
                The architecture of the concurrent stack is shown in <xref linkend="ConcurrentStackFig"/>. The changes
                were made entirely inside of the transport protocol (TP, with subclasses UDP, TCP and TCP_NIO). Therefore,
                to configure the concurrent stack, the user has to modify the config for (e.g.) UDP in the XML file.
            </para>

            </para>

            <para>
                The concurrent stack consists of 2 thread pools (java.util.concurrent.Executor): the out-of-band (OOB)
                thread pool and the regular thread pool. Packets are received by multicast or unicast receiver threads
                (UDP) or a ConnectionTable (TCP, TCP_NIO). Packets marked as OOB (with Message.setFlag(Message.OOB)) are
                dispatched to the OOB thread pool, and all other packets are dispatched to the regular thread pool.
            </para>

            <para>
                When a thread pool is disabled, then we use the thread of the caller (e.g. multicast or unicast
                receiver threads or the ConnectionTable) to send the message up the stack and into the application.
                Otherwise, the packet will be processed by a thread from the thread pool, which sends the message up
                the stack. When all current threads are busy, another thread might be created, up to the maximum number
                of threads defined. Alternatively, the packet might get queued up until a thread becomes available.
            </para>

            <para>
                The point of using a thread pool is that the receiver threads should only receive the packets and forward
                them to the thread pools for processing, because unmarshalling and processing is slower than simply
                receiving the message and can benefit from parallelization.

                <para>
                    We are thinking of exposing the thread pools programmatically, meaning that a developer might be able to set both
                    threads pools programmatically, e.g. using something like TP.setOOBThreadPool(Executor executor).

            <title>Elimination of up and down threads</title>

            <para>
                By removing the 2 queues/protocol and the associated 2 threads, we effectively reduce the number of
                threads needed to handle a message, and thus context switching overhead. We also get clear and unambiguous
                semantics for Channel.send(): now, all messages are sent down the stack on the caller's thread and
                the send() call only returns once the message has been put on the network. In addition, an exception will
                only be propagated back to the caller if the message has not yet been placed in a retransmit buffer.
                Otherwise, JGroups simply logs the error message but keeps retransmitting the message. Therefore,
                if the caller gets an exception, the message should be re-sent.
            </para>
            <para>
                On the receiving side, a message is handled by a thread pool, either the regular or OOB thread pool. Both
                thread pools can be completely eliminated, so that we can save even more threads and thus further
                reduce context switching. The point is that the developer is now able to control the threading behavior
                almost completely.

            <title>Concurrent message delivery</title>
            <para>
                Up to version 2.5, all messages received were processed by a single thread, even if the messages were
                sent by different senders. For instance, if sender A sent messages 1,2 and 3, and B sent message 34 and 45,
                and if A's messages were all received first, then B's messages 34 and 35 could only be processed after
                messages 1-3 from A were processed !
            </para>
            <para>
                Now, we can process messages from different senders in parallel, e.g. messages 1, 2 and 3 from A can be
                processed by one thread from the thread pool and messages 34 and 35 from B can be processed on a different
                thread.
            </para>
            <para>
                As a result, we get a speedup of almost N for a cluster of N if every node is sending messages and we
                configure the thread pool to have at least N threads. There is actually a unit test
                (ConcurrentStackTest.java) which demonstrates this.

        <section id="Scopes">
            <title>Scopes: concurrent message delivery for messages from the same sender</title>
            <para>
                In the previous paragraph, we showed how the concurrent stack delivers messages from different senders
                concurrently. But all (non-OOB) messages from the same sender P are delivered in the order in which
                P sent them. However, this is not good enough for certain types of applications.
            </para>
            <para>
                Consider the case of an application which replicates HTTP sessions. If we have sessions X, Y and Z, then
                updates to these sessions are delivered in the order in which there were performed, e.g. X1, X2, X3,
                Y1, Z1, Z2, Z3, Y2, Y3, X4. This means that update Y1 has to wait until updates X1-3 have been delivered.
                If these updates take some time, e.g. spent in lock acquisition or deserialization, then all subsequent
                messages are delayed by the sum of the times taken by the messages ahead of them in the delivery order.
            </para>
            <para>
                However, in most cases, updates to different web sessions should be completely unrelated, so they could
                be delivered concurrently. For instance, a modification to session X should not have any effect on
                session Y, therefore updates to X, Y and Z can be delivered concurrently.
            </para>
            <para>
                One solution to this is out-of-band (OOB) messages (see next paragraph). However, OOB messages do not
                guarantee ordering, so updates X1-3 could be delivered as X1, X3, X2. If this is not wanted, but
                messages pertaining to a given web session should all be delivered concurrently between sessions, but
                ordered <emphasis>within</emphasis> a given session, then we can resort to <emphasis>scoped messages</emphasis>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Scoped messages apply only to <emphasis>regular</emphasis> (non-OOB) messages, and are delivered
                concurrently between scopes, but ordered within a given scope. For example, if we used the sessions above
                (e.g. the jsessionid) as scopes, then the delivery could be as follows ('->' means sequential, '||' means concurrent):
                <screen>X1 -> X2 -> X3 -> X4 || Y1 -> Y2 -> Y3 || Z1 -> Z2 -> Z3</screen>
                This means that all updates to X are delivered in parallel to updates to Y and updates to Z. However, within
                a given scope, updates are delivered in the order in which they were performed, so X1 is delivered before
                X2, which is deliverd before X3 and so on.
            </para>
            <para>
                Taking the above example, using scoped messages, update Y1 does <emphasis>not</emphasis> have to wait for
                updates X1-3 to complete, but is processed immediately.
            </para>
            <para>
                To set the scope of a message, use method Message.setScope(short).
            </para>
            <para>
                Scopes are implemented in a separate protocol called <xref linkend="SCOPE"/>. This protocol
                has to be placed somewhere above ordering protocols like UNICAST or NAKACK (or SEQUENCER for that matter).
            </para>

            <note>
                <title>Uniqueness of scopes</title>
                <para>
                    Note that scopes should be <emphasis>as unique as possible</emphasis>. Compare this to hashing: the fewer collisions
                    there are, the better the concurrency will be. So, if for example, two web sessions pick the same
                    scope, then updates to those sessions will be delivered in the order in which they were sent, and
                    not concurrently. While this doesn't cause erraneous behavior, it defies the purpose of SCOPE.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Also note that, if multicast and unicast messages have the same scope, they will be delivered
                    in sequence. So if A multicasts messages to the group with scope 25, and A also unicasts messages
                    to B with scope 25, then A's multicasts and unicasts will be delivered in order at B ! Again,
                    this is correct, but since multicasts and unicasts are unrelated, might slow down things !

        <section id="OOB">
            <title>Out-of-band messages</title>
            <para>
                OOB messages completely ignore any ordering constraints the stack might have. Any message marked as OOB
                will be processed by the OOB thread pool. This is necessary in cases where we don't want the message
                processing to wait until all other messages from the same sender have been processed, e.g. in the
                heartbeat case: if sender P sends 5 messages and then a response to a heartbeat request received from
                some other node, then the time taken to process P's 5 messages might take longer than the heartbeat
                timeout, so that P might get falsely suspected ! However, if the heartbeat response is marked as OOB,
                then it will get processed by the OOB thread pool and therefore might be concurrent to its previously
                sent 5 messages and not trigger a false suspicion.
            </para>
            <para>
                The 2 unit tests UNICAST_OOB_Test and NAKACK_OOB_Test demonstrate how OOB messages influence the ordering,
                for both unicast and multicast messages.

            <para>
                In 2.7, the default and OOB thread pools can be shared between instances running inside the same JVM. The
                advantage here is that multiple channels running within the same JVM can pool (and therefore save) threads.
                The disadvantage is that thread naming will not show to which channel instance an incoming thread
                belongs to.
            </para>
            <para>
                Note that we can not just shared thread pools between JChannels within the same JVM, but we can also
                share entire transports. For details see <xref linkend="SharedTransport">this section</xref>.

            <title>Using a custom socket factory</title>
            <para>
                JGroups creates all of its sockets through a SocketFactory, which is located in the transport (TP) or
                TP.ProtocolAdapter (in a shared transport). The factory has methods to create sockets (Socket,
                ServerSocket, DatagramSocket and MulticastSocket)
                <footnote>
                    <para>
                        Currently, SocketFactory does not support creation of NIO sockets / channels.
                    </para>
                </footnote>,
                closen sockets and list all open sockets. Every socket creation method has a service name, which could
                be for example "jgroups.fd_sock.srv_sock". The service name is used to look up a port (e.g. in a config
                file) and create the correct socket.
            </para>
            <para>
                To provide one's own socket factory, the following has to be done: if we have a non-shared transport,
                the code below creates a SocketFactory implementation and sets it in the transport:
            </para>
            <programlisting language="Java">
JChannel ch;
MySocketFactory factory; // e.g. extends DefaultSocketFactory
ch=new JChannel("config.xml");
ch.setSocketFactory(new MySocketFactory());
ch.connect("demo");
            </programlisting>

            <para>
                If a shared transport is used, then we have to set 2 socket factories: 1 in the shared transport and
                one in the TP.ProtocolAdapter:
            </para>
            <programlisting language="Java">
JChannel c1=new JChannel("config.xml"), c2=new JChannel("config.xml");

TP transport=c1.getProtocolStack().getTransport();
transport.setSocketFactory(new MySocketFactory("transport"));

c1.setSocketFactory(new MySocketFactory("first-cluster"));
c2.setSocketFactory(new MySocketFactory("second-cluster"));

c1.connect("first-cluster");
c2.connect("second-cluster");
            </programlisting>

            <para>
                First, we grab one of the channels to fetch the transport and set a SocketFactory in it. Then we
                set one SocketFactory per channel that resides on the shared transport. When JChannel.connect() is
                called, the SocketFactory will be set in TP.ProtocolAdapter.

        <title>Handling network partitions</title>

        <para>
            Network partitions can be caused by switch, router or network interface crashes, among other things. If we
            have a cluster {A,B,C,D,E} spread across 2 subnets {A,B,C} and {D,E} and the switch to which D and E are
            connected crashes, then we end up with a network partition, with subclusters {A,B,C} and {D,E}.
        </para>
        <para>
            A, B and C can ping each other, but not D or E, and vice versa. We now have 2 coordinators, A and D. Both
            subclusters operate independently, for example, if we maintain a shared state, subcluster {A,B,C} replicate
            changes to A, B and C.
        </para>
        <para>
            This means, that if during the partition, some clients access {A,B,C}, and others {D,E}, then we end up
            with different states in both subclusters. When a partition heals, the merge protocol (e.g. MERGE2) will
            notify A and D that there were 2 subclusters and merge them back into {A,B,C,D,E}, with A being the new
            coordinator and D ceasing to be coordinator.
        </para>
        <para>
            The question is what happens with the 2 diverged substates ?
        </para>
        <para>
            There are 2 solutions to merging substates: first we can attempt to create a new state from the 2 substates,
            and secondly we can shut down all members of the <emphasis>non primary partition</emphasis>, such that they
            have to re-join and possibly reacquire the state from a member in the primary partition.
        </para>
        <para>
            In both cases, the application has to handle a MergeView (subclass of View), as shown in the code below:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="Java">
public void viewAccepted(View view) {
    if(view instanceof MergeView) {
        MergeView tmp=(MergeView)view;
        Vector&lt;View&gt; subgroups=tmp.getSubgroups();
        // merge state or determine primary partition
        // run in a separate thread !
    }
}
        </programlisting>

        <para>
            It is essential that the merge view handling code run on a separate thread if it needs more than a few
            milliseconds, or else it would block the calling thread.
        </para>
        <para>
            The MergeView contains a list of views, each view represents a subgroups and has the list of members which
            formed this group.

                The application has to merge the substates from the various subgroups ({A,B,C} and {D,E}) back into one
                single state for {A,B,C,D,E}. This task <emphasis>has</emphasis> to be done by the application because
                JGroups knows nothing about the application state, other than it is a byte buffer.
            </para>
            <para>
                If the in-memory state is backed by a database, then the solution is easy: simply discard the in-memory
                state and fetch it (eagerly or lazily) from the DB again. This of course assumes that the members of
                the 2 subgroups were able to write their changes to the DB. However, this is often not the case, as
                connectivity to the DB might have been severed by the network partition.
            </para>
            <para>
                Another solution could involve tagging the state with time stamps. On merging, we could compare the
                time stamps for the substates and let the substate with the more recent time stamps win.
            </para>
            <para>
                Yet another solution could increase a counter for a state each time the state has been modified. The state
                with the highest counter wins.
            </para>
            <para>
                Again, the merging of state can only be done by the application. Whatever algorithm is picked to merge
                state, it has to be deterministic.

            <title>The primary partition approach</title>
        </section>
        <para>
            The primary partition approach is simple: on merging, one subgroup is designated as the
            <emphasis>primary partition</emphasis> and all others as non-primary partitions. The members in the primary
            partition don't do anything, whereas the members in the non-primary partitions need to drop their state and
            re-initialize their state from fresh state obtained from a member of the primary partition.
        </para>
        <para>
            The code to find the primary partition needs to be deterministic, so that all members pick the <emphasis>
            same</emphasis> primary partition. This could be for example the first view in the MergeView, or we could
            sort all members of the new MergeView and pick the subgroup which contained the new coordinator (the one
            from the consolidated MergeView). Another possible solution could be to pick the largest subgroup, and, if
            there is a tie, sort the tied views lexicographically (all Addresses have a compareTo() method) and pick the
            subgroup with the lowest ranked member.
        </para>
        <para>
            Here's code which picks as primary partition the first view in the MergeView, then re-acquires the state from
            the <emphasis>new</emphasis> coordinator of the combined view:

        <para>
            The handleView() method is called from viewAccepted(), which is called whenever there is a new view. It spawns
            a new thread which gets the subgroups from the MergeView, and picks the first subgroup to be the primary
            partition. Then, if it was a member of the primary partition, it does nothing, and if not, it reaqcuires
            the state from the coordinator of the primary partition (A).
        </para>
        <para>
            The downside to the primary partition approach is that work (= state changes) on the non-primary partition
            is discarded on merging. However, that's only problematic if the data was purely in-memory data, and not
            backed by persistent storage. If the latter's the case, use state merging discussed above.
        </para>
        <para>
            It would be simpler to shut down the non-primary partition as soon as the network partition is detected, but
            that a non trivial problem, as we don't know whether {D,E} simply crashed, or whether they're still alive,
            but were partitioned away by the crash of a switch. This is called a <emphasis>split brain syndrome</emphasis>,
            and means that none of the members has enough information to determine whether it is in the primary or
            non-primary partition, by simply exchanging messages.

            <para>
                In certain situations, we can avoid having multiple subgroups where every subgroup is able to make
                progress, and on merging having to discard state of the non-primary partitions.

            <para>
                If we have a fixed membership, e.g. the cluster always consists of 5 nodes, then we can run code on
                a view reception that determines the primary partition. This code
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>assumes that the primary partition has to have at least 3 nodes</listitem>
                    <listitem>any cluster which has less than 3 nodes doesn't accept modfications. This could be done for
                        shared state for example, by simply making the {D,E} partition read-only. Clients can access the
                        {D,E} partition and read state, but not modify it.
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        As an alternative, clusters without at least 3 members could shut down, so in this case D and
                        E would leave the cluster.

                The algorithm is shown in pseudo code below:
                <screen>
On initialization:
    - Mark the node as read-only
                    
On view change V:
    - If V has >= N members:
        - If not read-write: get state from coord and switch to read-write
    - Else: switch to read-only

            </para>
            <para>
                Of course, the above mechanism requires that at least 3 nodes are up at any given time, so upgrades have
                to be done in a staggered way, taking only one node down at a time. In the worst case, however, this
                mechanism leaves the cluster read-only and notifies a system admin, who can fix the issue. This is still
                better than shutting the entire cluster down.

        <title>Flushing: making sure every node in the cluster received a message</title>

        When sending messages, the properties of the default stacks (udp.xml, tcp.xml) are that all messages are delivered
        reliably to all (non-crashed) members. However, there are no guarantees with respect to the view in which a message
        will get delivered. For example, when a member A with view V1={A,B,C} multicasts message M1 to the group and D joins
        at about the same time, then D may or may not receive M1, and there is no guarantee that A, B and C receive M1 in
        V1 or V2={A,B,C,D}.

        <para>
            To change this, we can turn on virtual synchrony (by adding FLUSH to the top of the stack), which guarantees that
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    A message M sent in V1 will be delivered in V1. So, in the example above, M1 would get delivered in
                    view V1; by A, B and C, but not by D.
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    The set of messages seen by members in V1 is the same for all members before a new view V2 is installed.
                    This is important, as it ensures that all members in a given view see the same messages. For example,
                    in a group {A,B,C}, C sends 5 messages. A receives all 5 messages, but B doesn't. Now C crashes before
                    it can retransmit the messages to B. FLUSH will now ensure, that before installing V2={A,B} (excluding
                    C), B gets C's 5 messages. This is done through the flush protocol, which has all members reconcile
                    their messages before a new view is installed. In this case, A will send C's 5 messages to B.
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
            Sometimes it is important to know that every node in the cluster received all messages up to a certain point,
            even if there is no new view being installed. To do this (initiate a manual flush), an application programmer
            can call Channel.startFlush() to start a flush and Channel.stopFlush() to terminate it.
        </para>

        <para>
            Channel.startFlush() flushes all pending messages out of the system. This stops all senders (calling
            Channel.down() during a flush will block until the flush has completed)<footnote><para>Note that block()
            will be called in a Receiver when the flush is about to start and unblock() will be called when it ends</para></footnote>.
            When startFlush() returns, the caller knows that (a) no messages will get sent anymore until stopFlush() is
            called and (b) all members have received all messages sent before startFlush() was called.
        </para>

        <para>
            Channel.stopFlush() terminates the flush protocol, no blocked senders can resume sending messages.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note that the FLUSH protocol has to be present on top of the stack, or else the flush will fail.

            <title>Reducing chattiness</title>
            <para>
                When we have a chatty protocol, scaling to a large number of nodes might be a problem: too many messages
                are sent and - because they are generated in addition to the regular traffic - this can have a
                negative impact on the cluster. A possible impact is that more of the regular messages are dropped, and
                have to be retransmitted, which impacts performance. Or heartbeats are dropped, leading to false
                suspicions. So while the negative effects of chatty protocols may not be seen in small clusters, they
                <emphasis>will</emphasis> be seen in large clusters !

                <title>Discovery</title>
                <para>
                    A discovery protocol (e.g. PING, TCPPING, MPING etc) is run at startup, to discover the initial
                    membership, and periodically by the merge protocol, to detect partitioned subclusters.
                </para>
                <para>
                    When we send a multicast discovery request to a large cluster, every node in the cluster might
                    possibly reply with a discovery response sent back to the sender. So, in a cluster of 300 nodes,
                    the discovery requester might be up to 299 discovery responses ! Even worse, because num_ping_requests
                    in Discovery is by default set to 2, so we're sending 2 discovery requests, we might receive up to
                    num_ping_requests * (N-1) discovery responses, even though we might be able to find out the
                    coordinator after a few responses already !
                </para>
                <para>
                    To reduce the large number of responses, we can set a max_rank property: the value defines which
                    members are going to send a discovery response. The rank is the index of a member in a cluster: in
                    {A,B,C,D,E}, A's index is 1, B's index is 2 and so on. A max_rank of 3 would trigger discovery
                    responses from only A, B and C, but not from D or E.
                </para>
                <para>
                    We highly recommend setting max_rank in large clusters.

                    Failure detection protocols determine when a member is unresponsive, and subsequently

                    the health of a member, but we can also use TCP connections (FD_SOCK) to connect to a member P, and
                    suspect P when the connection is closed.

                <para>
                    Heartbeating requires messages to be sent around, and we need to be careful to limit the number of

                    has been suspected. The following sections discuss how to configure FD_ALL, FD and FD_SOCK, the most

        <title>Bridging between remote clusters</title>
        <para>
            In 2.12, the RELAY protocol was added to JGroups (for the properties see <xref linkend="RELAY">RELAY</xref>).
            It allows for bridging of remote clusters. For example, if we have a cluster in New York (NYC) and another
            one in San Francisco (SFO), then RELAY allows us to bridge NYC and SFO, so that multicast messages sent in
            NYC will be forwarded to SFO and vice versa.
        </para>
        <para>
            The NYC and SFO clusters could for example use IP multicasting (UDP as transport), and the bridge could use
            TCP as transport. The SFO and NYC clusters don't even need to use the same cluster name.

            The cluster on the left side with nodes A (the coordinator), B and C is called "NYC" and use IP

        </para>
        <para>
            The bridge between the local clusters NYC and SFO is essentially another cluster with the coordinators
            (A and D) of the local clusters as members. The bridge typically uses TCP as transport, but any of the
            supported JGroups transports could be used (including UDP, if supported across a WAN, for instance).
        </para>
        <para>
            Only a coordinator relays traffic between the local and remote cluster. When A crashes or leaves, then the
            next-in-line (B) takes over and starts relaying.
        </para>
        <para>
            Relaying is done via the RELAY protocol added to the top of the stack. The bridge is configured with
            the bridge_props property, e.g. bridge_props="/home/bela/tcp.xml". This creates a JChannel inside RELAY.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that property "site" must be set in both subclusters. In the example above, we could set site="nyc"
            for the NYC subcluster and site="sfo" for the SFO ubcluster.
        </para>
        <para>
            The design is described in detail in JGroups/doc/design/RELAY.txt (part of the source distribution). In
            a nutshell, multicast messages received in a local cluster are wrapped and forwarded to the remote cluster
            by a relay (= the coordinator of a local cluster). When a remote cluster receives such a message, it is
            unwrapped and put onto the local cluster.
        </para>
        <para>
            JGroups uses subclasses of UUID (PayloadUUID) to ship the site name with an address. When we see an address
            with site="nyc" on the SFO side, then RELAY will forward the message to the SFO subcluster, and vice versa.
            When C multicasts a message in the NYC cluster, A will forward it to D, which will re-broadcast the message on
            its local cluster, with the sender being D. This means that the sender of the local broadcast will appear
            as D (so all retransmit requests got to D), but the original sender C is preserved in the header.
            At the RELAY protocol, the sender will be replaced with the original sender (C) having site="nyc".
            When node F wants to reply to the sender of the multicast, the destination
            of the message will be C, which is intercepted by the RELAY protocol and forwarded to the current
            relay (D). D then picks the correct destination (C) and sends the message to the remote cluster, where
            A makes sure C (the original sender) receives it.
        </para>
        <para>
            An important design goal of RELAY is to be able to have completely autonomous clusters, so NYC doesn't for
            example have to block waiting for credits from SFO, or a node in the SFO cluster doesn't have to ask a node
            in NYC for retransmission of a missing message.
        </para>

            <title>Views</title>
            <para>
                RELAY presents a <emphasis>global view</emphasis> to the application, e.g. a view received by
                nodes could be {D,E,F,A,B,C}. This view is the same on all nodes, and a global view is generated by
                taking the two local views, e.g. A|5 {A,B,C} and D|2 {D,E,F}, comparing the coordinators' addresses
                (the UUIDs for A and D) and concatenating the views into a list. So if D's UUID is greater than
                A's UUID, we first add D's members into the global view ({D,E,F}), and then A's members.
            </para>
            <para>
                Therefore, we'll always see all of A's members, followed by all of D's members, or the other way round.
            </para>
            <para>
                To see which nodes are local and which ones remote, we can iterate through the addresses (PayloadUUID)
                and use the site (PayloadUUID.getPayload()) name to for example differentiate between "nyc" and "sfo".

            <title>Configuration</title>
            <para>
                To setup a relay, we need essentially 3 XML configuration files: 2 to configure the local clusters and
                1 for the bridge.
            </para>
            <para>
                To configure the first local cluster, we can copy udp.xml from the JGroups distribution and add RELAY on top
                of it: &lt;RELAY bridge_props="/home/bela/tcp.xml" /&gt;. Let's say we call this config relay.xml.
            </para>
            <para>
                The second local cluster can be configured by copying relay.xml to relay2.xml. Then change the
                mcast_addr and/or mcast_port, so we actually have 2 different cluster in case we run instances of
                both clusters in the same network. Of course, if the nodes of one cluster are run in a different
                network from the nodes of the other cluster, and they cannot talk to each other, then we can simply
                use the same configuration.
            </para>
            <para>
                The 'site' property needs to be configured in relay.xml and relay2.xml, and it has to be different. For
                example, relay.xml could use site="nyc" and relay2.xml could use site="sfo".
            </para>
            <para>
                The bridge is configured by taking the stock tcp.xml and making sure both local clusters can see each
                other through TCP.

    <section id="DaisyChaining">
        <title>Daisychaining</title>
        <para>
            Daisychaining refers to a way of disseminating messages sent to the entire cluster.
        </para>
        <para>
            The idea behind it is that it is inefficient to broadcast a message in clusters where IP multicasting is
            not available. For example, if we only have TCP available (as is the case in most clouds today), then we
            have to send a broadcast (or group) message N-1 times. If we want to broadcast M to a cluster of 10,
            we send the same message 9 times.
        </para>
        <para>
            Example: if we have {A,B,C,D,E,F}, and A broadcasts M, then it sends it to B, then to C, then to D etc.
            If we have a 1 GB switch, and M is 1GB, then sending a broadcast to 9 members takes 9 seconds, even if we
            parallelize the sending of M. This is due to the fact that the link to the switch only sustains 1GB / sec.
            (Note that I'm conveniently ignoring the fact that the switch will start dropping packets if it is
            overloaded, causing TCP to retransmit, slowing things down)...
        </para>
        <para>
            Let's introduce the concept of a round. A round is the time it takes to send or receive a message.
            In the above example, a round takes 1 second if we send 1 GB messages.
            In the existing N-1 approach, it takes X * (N-1) rounds to send X messages to a cluster of N nodes.
            So to broadcast 10 messages a the cluster of 10, it takes 90 rounds.
        </para>
        <para>
            Enter DAISYCHAIN.
        </para>

        <para>
            The idea is that, instead of sending a message to N-1 members, we only send it to our neighbor, which
            forwards it to its neighbor, and so on. For example, in {A,B,C,D,E}, D would broadcast a message by
            forwarding it to E, E forwards it to A, A to B, B to C and C to D. We use a time-to-live field,
            which gets decremented on every forward, and a message gets discarded when the time-to-live is 0.
        </para>
        <para>
            The advantage is that, instead of taxing the link between a member and the switch to send N-1 messages,
            we distribute the traffic more evenly across the links between the nodes and the switch.
            Let's take a look at an example, where A broadcasts messages m1 and m2 in
            cluster {A,B,C,D}, '-->' means sending:

            <title>Switch usage</title>
            <para>
                Let's take a look at this in terms of switch usage: in the N-1 approach, A can only send 125MB/sec,
                no matter how many members there are in the cluster, so it is constrained by the link capacity to the
                switch. (Note that A can also receive 125MB/sec in parallel with today's full duplex links).
            </para>
            <para>
                So the link between A and the switch gets hot.
            </para>
            <para>
                In the daisychaining approach, link usage is more even: if we look for example at round 2, A sending
                to B and B sending to C uses 2 different links, so there are no constraints regarding capacity of a
                link. The same goes for B sending to C and C sending to D.
            </para>
            <para>
                In terms of rounds, the daisy chaining approach uses X + (N-2) rounds, so for a cluster size of 10 and
                broadcasting 10 messages, it requires only 18 rounds, compared to 90 for the N-1 approach !

                To measure performance of DAISYCHAIN, a performance test (test.Perf) was run, with 4 nodes connected
                to a 1 GB switch; and every node sending 1 million 8K messages, for a total of 32GB received by
                every node. The config used was tcp.xml.
            </para>
            <para>
                The N-1 approach yielded a throughput of 73 MB/node/sec, and the daisy chaining approach 107MB/node/sec !

            Ergonomics is similar to the dynamic setting of optimal values for the JVM, e.g. garbage collection,
            memory sizes etc. In JGroups, ergonomics means that we try to dynamically determine and set optimal
            values for protocol properties. Examples are thread pool size, flow control credits, heartbeat
            frequency and so on.

        <para>
            There is an <literal>ergonomics</literal> property which can be enabled or disabled for every protocol.
            The default is true. To disable it, set it to false, e.g.:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="XML">
&lt;UDP... /&gt;
&lt;PING ergonomics="false"/&gt;
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            Here we leave ergonomics enabled for UDP (the default is true), but disable it for PING.
        </para>
        <para>
            Ergonomics is work-in-progress.
