[[user-channel]]
== API

This chapter explains the classes available in JGroups that will be used by applications to build reliable group
communication applications. The focus is on creating and using channels.

All of the classes discussed here are in the org.jgroups package unless otherwise mentioned.
    

[[UtilityClasses]]
=== Utility classes

The `org.jgroups.util.Util` class contains useful common functionality which cannot be assigned to any other package.


[[objectToByteBuffer]]
==== objectToByteBuffer(), objectFromByteBuffer()

The first method takes an object as argument and serializes it into a byte buffer (the object has to
be serializable or externalizable). The byte array is then returned. This method is often used to
serialize objects into the byte buffer of a message. The second method returns a reconstructed object
from a buffer. Both methods throw an exception if the object cannot be serialized or unserialized.


[[objectToStream]]
==== objectToStream(), objectFromStream()

The first method takes an object and writes it to an output stream. The second method takes an
input stream and reads an object from it.
Both methods throw an exception if the object cannot be serialized or unserialized.


[[Interfaces]]
=== Interfaces
These interfaces are used with some of the APIs presented below, therefore they are listed first.

[[MessageListener]]
==== MessageListener

The MessageListener interface below provides callbacks for message reception and
for providing and setting the state:

[source,java]
----
public interface MessageListener {
    void receive(Message msg);
    void receive(MessageBatch batch);
    void getState(OutputStream output) throws Exception;
    void setState(InputStream input) throws Exception;
}
----

Method `receive()` is called whenever a message is received and `receive(MessageBatch)` is called when a message
batch is received.

The `getState()` and `setState()` methods are used to fetch and set the group state (e.g. when joining).
Refer to <<StateTransfer,State transfer>> for a discussion of state transfer.


[[MembershipListener]]
==== MembershipListener

The MembershipListener interface is similar to the `MessageListener` interface above: every time a new view, a suspicion message,
or a block event is received, the corresponding method of the class implementing `MembershipListener`  will be called.
            
[source,java]
----
public interface MembershipListener {
    void viewAccepted(View new_view);
    void suspect(Object suspected_mbr);
    void block();
    void unblock();
}
----

Oftentimes the only callback that needs to be implemented will be
`viewAccepted()` which notifies the receiver that a new member has joined the
group or that an existing member has left or crashed. The `suspect()`
callback is invoked by JGroups whenever a member if suspected of having crashed, but not yet excluded
footnote:[It could be that the member is suspected falsely, in which case the next view would still contain the
suspected member (there is no unsuspect() method].


The `block()` method is called to notify the member that it will soon be blocked
sending messages. This is done by the FLUSH protocol, for example to ensure that nobody is sending
messages while a state transfer or view installation is in progress. When block() returns, any thread
sending messages will be blocked, until FLUSH unblocks the thread again, e.g. after the state has been
transferred successfully.
            
Therefore, `block()` can be used to send pending messages or complete some other work.
Note that block() should be brief, or else the entire `FLUSH` protocol is blocked.
            
The `unblock()` method is called to notify the member that the FLUSH protocol has completed and the member can resume
sending messages. If the member did not stop sending messages on block(), FLUSH simply blocked them and
will resume, so no action is required from a member. Implementation of the unblock() callback is optional.
            
NOTE: Note that it is oftentimes simpler to extend `ReceiverAdapter` (see below) and implement the needed
callbacks than to implement all methods of both of these interfaces, as most callbacks are not needed.


[[Receiver]]
==== Receiver

[source,java]
----
public interface Receiver extends MessageListener, MembershipListener;
----

A `Receiver` can be used to receive messages and view changes; `receive()` will be invoked as soon as a
message has been received, and `viewAccepted()` will be called whenever a new view is installed.
            

[[ReceiverAdapter]]
==== ReceiverAdapter

This class implements Receiver with no-op implementations. When implementing a callback, we can simply
extend ReceiverAdapter and overwrite receive() in order to not having to implement all callbacks of the interface.
            

ReceiverAdapter looks as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class ReceiverAdapter implements Receiver {
    void receive(Message msg) {}
    void receive(MessageBatch batch) {}
    void getState(OutputStream output) throws Exception {}
    void setState(InputStream input) throws Exception {}
    void viewAccepted(View view) {}
    void suspect(Address mbr) {}
    void block() {}
    void unblock() {}
}
----

A ReceiverAdapter is the recommended way to implement callbacks.

CAUTION: Note that anything that could block should _not_ be done in a callback. This includes sending of messages;
if we have FLUSH on the stack, and send a message in a viewAccepted() callback, then the following happens:
the FLUSH protocol blocks all
(multicast) messages before installing a view, then installs the view, then unblocks. However,
because installation of the view triggers the viewAccepted() callback, sending of messages inside of
viewAccepted() will block. This in turn blocks the viewAccepted() thread, so the flush will never return! +
If we need to send a message in a callback, the sending should be done on a separate thread, or a
timer task should be submitted to the timer.


[[ChannelListener]]
==== ChannelListener

[source,java]
----
public interface ChannelListener {
    void channelConnected(JChannel channel);
    void channelDisconnected(JChannel channel);
    void channelClosed(JChannel channel);
}
----

A class implementing ChannelListener can use the JChannel.addChannelListener()
method to register with a channel to obtain information about state changes in a channel. Whenever a
channel is closed, disconnected or opened, the corresponding callback will be invoked.
            

[[Address]]
=== Address

Each member of a group has an address, which uniquely identifies the member. The interface for such an
address is `Address`, which requires concrete implementations to provide methods such as comparison and
sorting of addresses. JGroups addresses have to implement the following interface:
        
[source,java]
----
public interface Address extends Streamable, Comparable<Address> {
    int size();
}
----

For marshalling purposes, `size()` needs to return the number of bytes an instance of an address implementation
takes up in serialized form.
        
WARNING: Please never use implementations of Address directly; Address should always be used as an opaque identifier of
a cluster node!
        
Actual implementations of addresses are generated by the transport protocol (e.g. `UDP` or `TCP`).
This allows for all possible types of addresses to be used with JGroups.
        
Since an address uniquely identifies a channel, and therefore a group member, it
can be used to send messages to that group member, e.g. in Messages (see next section).
        
The default implementation of Address is `org.jgroups.util.UUID`. It uniquely identifies
a node, and when disconnecting and reconnecting to a cluster, a node is given a new UUID on reconnection.
        
UUIDs are never shown directly, but are usually shown as a logical name (see <<LogicalName,Logical names>>).
This is a name given to a node either via the user or via JGroups, and its sole purpose is to make logging
output a bit more readable.
        
UUIDs maps to IpAddresses, which are IP addresses and ports. These are eventually used by the transport
protocol to send a message.

[[IpAddressUUID]]
==== IpAddressUUID
If `TP.use_ip_addrs` is enabled, then instead of using UUIDs, `IpAddressUUIDs` are used. These are IpAddresses with
some randomness added, to prevent reincarnation (restarting of a member under the same address and port, and
therefore having the same identity as the previous member).

The advantage of `IpAddressUUIDs` is that they always carry their physical address with them, therefore the discovery
phase needs to exchange less information and no lookup is needed to translate between UUIDs and IpAddresses.

The downside is that IpAddressUUIDs need more memory. See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-2080 for details.

        

[[Message]]
=== Message

Data is sent between members in the form of messages (`org.jgroups.BaseMessage`). A message can be sent by a member to
a _single member_, or to _all members_ of the group of which the channel is an endpoint.

The structure of a message is shown in <<MessageFig>>.

[[MessageFig]]
.Structure of a message
image::./images/Message.png[Message]

A message has 5 fields:

Destination address:: The address of the receiver. If `null`, the message will be sent to all
                    current group members. `Message.getDest()` returns the destination address of a message.

Source address:: The address of the sender. Can be `null`, and will be filled in by the
                 transport protocol (e.g. UDP) before the message is put on the network.
                 `Message.getSrc()` returns the source address, ie. the address of the sender of a message.

Flags:: This is one byte used for flags. The currently recognized flags are `OOB`, `DONT_BUNDLE`, `NO_FC`,
        `NO_RELIABILITY`, `NO_TOTAL_ORDER`, `NO_RELAY` and `RSVP`. For `OOB`, see the discussion on the
        <<TransportDetails,transport details>>. For the use of flags see <<MessageFlags,the message flags>>.
                    
Payload:: The actual data (as a byte buffer). The `Message` class contains convenience methods to set a
          serializable object and to retrieve it again, using serialization to convert the object to/from
          a byte buffer. A message also has an offset and a length, if the buffer is only a subrange
          of a larger buffer.
                    
Headers:: A list of headers that can be attached to a message. Anything that should not be in the
          payload can be attached to a message as a header. Methods `putHeader()`, `getHeader()` and `removeHeader()`
          of Message can be used to manipulate headers. +
          Note that headers are only used by protocol implementers; headers should not be added or
          removed by application code!


A message is similar to an IP packet and consists of the payload (a byte buffer) and the addresses of the
sender and receiver (as Addresses). Any message put on the network can be routed to its destination
(receiver address), and replies can be returned to the sender's address.

A message usually does not need to fill in the sender's address when sending a message; this is done
automatically by the protocol stack before a message is put on the network. However, there may be cases,
when the sender of a message wants to give an address different from its own, so that for example, a
response should be returned to some other member.

The destination address (receiver) can be an Address, denoting the address of a member, determined e.g.
from a message received previously, or it can be +null+, which means that the message
will be sent to all members of the group. A typical multicast message, sending string
+"Hello"+ to all members would look like this:

[source,java]
----
Message msg=new Message(null, "Hello");
channel.send(msg);
----


[[MessageBatch]]
=== MessageBatch

A message batch is a class used to deliver messages which includes a number of messages rather than just one. The sender
and destination (= receiver) of a batch _is the same for all messages of the batch_. A batch can be iterated over, e.g.

[source.java]
----
MessageBatch batch;
for(Message msg: batch) {
    // do something with msg
}
----

The advantage of a message batch is that multiple messages are delivered in one go; which means potential locks are
acquired only once, we have fewer threads (less work for the thread pool) and fewer context switches.

JGroups tries to bundle as many messages as possible into a batch on the sender side.

Also on the receiver side, if multiple threads added messages to a table, it tries to remove as many of them as possible
and pass them up to other protocols (or the application) as a batch.


[[Header]]
=== Header

A header is a custom bit of information that can be added to each message. JGroups uses headers extensively,
for example to add sequence numbers to each message (NAKACK and UNICAST), so that those messages can be
delivered in the order in which they were sent.
        

[[Event]]
=== Event

Events are means by which JGroups protcols can talk to each other. Contrary to Messages, which travel over
the network between group members, events only travel up and down the stack.
        
NOTE: Headers and events are only used by protocol implementers; they are not needed by application code!
            

[[View]]
=== View

A view (`org.jgroups.View`) is a list of the current members of a group. It consists
of a `ViewId`, which uniquely identifies the view (see below), and a list of members.
Views are installed in a channel automatically by the underlying protocol stack whenever a new member joins
or an existing one leaves (or crashes). All members of a group see the same sequence of views.
        
Note that the first member of a view is the _coordinator_ (the one who emits new views).
Thus, whenever the membership changes, every member can determine the coordinator easily and without having
to contact other members, by picking the first member of a view.
        
The code below shows how to send a (unicast) message to the first member of a view (error checking code
omitted):
        
[source,java]
----
View view=channel.getView();
Address first=view.getMembers().get(0);
Message msg=new Message(first, "Hello world");
channel.send(msg);
----

Whenever an application is notified that a new view has been installed (e.g. by
`Receiver.viewAccepted()`, the view is already set in the channel. For example,
calling `Channel.getView()` in a `viewAccepted()`
callback would return the same view (or possibly the next one in case there has already been a new view!).
        

[[ViewId]]
==== ViewId

The `ViewId` is used to uniquely number views. It consists of the address of the view creator and a
sequence number. ViewIds can be compared for equality and put in a hashmaps as they implement equals()
and hashCode().

NOTE: Note that the latter 2 methods only take the ID into account.
            

[[MergeView]]
==== MergeView

Whenever a group splits into subgroups, e.g. due to a network partition, and later the subgroups merge
back together, a `MergeView` instead of a View will be received by the application. MergeView is
a subclass of View and contains as additional instance variables the list of views that were merged.

As an example if the cluster with view V1={P,Q,R,S,T} split into subgroups
V2={P,Q,R} and V2={S,T}, the merged view might be V3={P,Q,R,S,T}. In this case the MergeView contains a list of
two views: V2={P,Q,R}) and V2={S,T}.

NOTE: Because the default merge policy adds members from subgroups into a common group and sorts the resulting list, the
membership order might change on a merge event. Thus a view V1={P,Q,R,S,T}, followed by view V2={P,Q,R} and V2={S,T}
might result in a merge view V3={P,T,Q,S,R}. To prevent this, the task of creating new views can be delegated to
custom code (see <<MembershipChangePolicy>>).

WARNING: Because merging needs to handle all edge cases, it is *not* guaranteed that subsequent MergeViews won't have
identical membership. For example, we we have view A2={A,B} in A and B3={B} in B, then a subsequent merge might install
view A4={A,B} in both A and B. In A's case, the membership between A2 and A4 doesn't change. An application has to be
able to handle duplicate subsequent merge views. Note that consecutive _regular_ views will never have duplicate members.


[[JChannel]]
=== JChannel

In order to join a group and send messages, a process has to create a channel. A channel is like a socket.
When a client connects to a channel, it gives the the name of the group it would like to join. Thus, a
channel is (in its connected state) always associated with a particular group. The protocol stack takes care
that channels with the same group name find each other: whenever a client connects to a channel given group
name G, then it tries to find existing channels with the same name, and joins them, resulting in a new view
being installed (which contains the new member). If no members exist, a new group will be created.
        

A state transition diagram for the major states a channel can assume are shown in <<ChannelStatesFig>>.
        
[[ChannelStatesFig]]
image::./images/ChannelStates.png[Channel states]

When a channel is first created, it is in the unconnected state.

An attempt to perform certain operations
which are only valid in the connected state (e.g. send/receive messages) will result in an exception.

After a successful connection by a client, it moves to the connected state. Now the channel will receive messages
from other members and may send messages to other members or to the group, and it will get notified when
new members join or leave. Getting the local address of a channel is guaranteed to be a valid operation in
this state (see below).

When the channel is disconnected, it moves back to the unconnected state.
Both a connected and unconnected channel may be closed, which makes the channel unusable for further
operations. Any attempt to do so will result in an exception. When a channel is closed directly
from a connected state, it will first be disconnected, and then closed.
        
The methods available for creating and manipulating channels are discussed now.
        

[[CreatingAChannel]]
==== Creating a channel

A channel is created using one of its public constructors (e.g. new JChannel()).

The most frequently used constructor of JChannel looks as follows:
            
[source,java]
----
public JChannel(String props) throws Exception;
----

The props argument points to an XML file containing the configuration of the
protocol stack to be used. This can be a String, but there are also other constructors which take for
example a DOM element or a URL (see the javadoc for details).

The code sample below shows how to create a channel based on an XML configuration file:

[source,java]
----
JChannel ch=new JChannel("/home/bela/udp.xml");
----

If the props argument is null, the default properties will be used. An exception will be thrown if the
channel cannot be created. Possible causes include protocols that were specified in the property
argument, but were not found, or wrong parameters to protocols.

For example, the Draw demo can be launched as follows:

----
java org.javagroups.demos.Draw -props file:/home/bela/udp.xml
----

or

----
java org.javagroups.demos.Draw -props http://www.jgroups.org/udp.xml
----

In the latter case, an application downloads its protocol stack specification from a server, which
allows for central administration of application properties.
            
A sample XML configuration looks like this (edited from `udp.xml`):
            

[source,xml]
----
<config xmlns="urn:org:jgroups"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    <MFC max_credits="2M"
         min_threshold="0.4"/>
    <FRAG2 frag_size="60K"  />
</config>
----

A stack is wrapped by `<config>` and `</config>` elements and lists all protocols from bottom
(`UDP`) to top (`FRAG2`). Each element defines one protocol.

Each protocol is implemented as a Java class. When a protocol stack is created based on the above XML
configuration, the first element ("UDP") becomes the bottom-most layer, the second one will be placed on
the first, etc: the stack is created from the bottom to the top.

Each element has to be the name of a Java class that resides in the `org.jgroups.protocols` package.
Note that only the base name has to be given, not the fully specified class name
(`UDP` instead of `org.jgroups.protocols.UDP`).
If the protocol class is not found, JGroups assumes that the name given is a fully qualified classname
and will therefore try to instantiate that class. If this does not work an exception is thrown.
This allows for protocol classes to reside in different packages altogether, e.g. a valid protocol name
could be `com.sun.eng.protocols.reliable.UCAST`.
            
Each layer may have zero or more arguments, which are specified as a list of name/value pairs in
parentheses directly after the protocol name. In the example above, UDP is configured with some options,
one of them being the IP multicast port (`mcast_port`) which is set to 45588, or to the value of
the system property `jgroups.udp.mcast_port`, if set.

NOTE: Note that all members in a group have to have the same protocol stack.
            

[[ProgrammaticCreation]]
===== Programmatic creation

Usually, channels are created by passing the name of an XML configuration file to the JChannel()
constructor. On top of this declarative configuration, JGroups provides an API to create a channel
programmatically.

The way to do this is to first create a JChannel, then an instance of
ProtocolStack, then add all desired protocols to the stack and finally calling `init()` on the stack
to set it up. The rest, e.g. calling `JChannel.connect()` is the same as with the declarative
creation.
                
An example of how to programmatically create a channel is shown below (copied from `ProgrammaticChat`):
                
[source,java]
----
public class ProgrammaticChat {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Protocol[] prot_stack={
          new UDP().setValue("bind_addr", InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1")), // <2>
          new PING(),
          new MERGE3(),
          new FD_SOCK(),
          new FD_ALL(),
          new VERIFY_SUSPECT(),
          new BARRIER(),
          new NAKACK2(),
          new UNICAST3(),
          new STABLE(),
          new GMS(),
          new UFC(),
          new MFC(),
          new FRAG2()};
        JChannel ch=new JChannel(prot_stack).name(args[0]); // <1>

        ch.setReceiver(new ReceiverAdapter() {
            public void viewAccepted(View new_view) {
                System.out.println("view: " + new_view);
            }

            public void receive(Message msg) {
                System.out.println("<< " + msg.getObject() + " [" + msg.getSrc() + "]");
            }
        });

        ch.connect("ChatCluster");
        for(;;) {
            String line=Util.readStringFromStdin(": ");
            ch.send(null, line);
        }
    }

}
----

First, the JChannel is created (1) with an array of protocols. The protocols have some fields already set, e.g.
`bind_addr` in `UDP` (2).

The protocols are arranged bottom-first; e.g. `UDP` as transport is first, then `PING` and so on, until `FRAG2`, which
is the top protocol. Every protocol can be configured via setters, but there is also a generic
`setValue(String attr_name, Object value)`, which can be used to configure protocols as well, as shown in the example.



[[LogicalName]]
==== Giving the channel a logical name

A channel can be given a logical name which is then used instead of the channel's address in `toString()`.
A logical name might show the function of a channel, e.g. `"HostA-HTTP-Cluster"`, which is more legible
than a UUID +3c7e52ea-4087-1859-e0a9-77a0d2f69f29+.
            

For example, when we have 3 channels, using logical names we might see a view `{A,B,C}`, which is nicer
than
`{`++56f3f99e-2fc0-8282-9eb0-866f542ae437++,++ee0be4af-0b45-8ed6-3f6e-92548bfa5cde++,
++9241a071-10ce-a931-f675-ff2e3240e1ad++`}`!
            

If no logical name is set, JGroups generates one, using the hostname and a random number, e.g.
`linux-3442`. If this is not desired and the UUIDs should be shown, use system property
`-Djgroups.print_uuids=true`.
            
The logical name can be set using:

[source,java]
----
public void setName(String logical_name);
----

This must be done _before_ connecting a channel. Note that the logical name stays
with a channel until the channel is destroyed, whereas a UUID is created on each connection.

When JGroups starts, it prints the logical name and the associated physical address(es):
                
[listing]
....
-------------------------------------------------------------------
GMS: address=mac-53465, cluster=DrawGroupDemo, physical address=192.168.1.3:49932
-------------------------------------------------------------------
....

The logical name is `mac-53465` and the physical address is `192.168.1.3:49932`. The UUID is not shown here.
            

[[CustomAddresses]]
==== Generating custom addresses

Since 2.12 address generation is pluggable. This means that an application can determine what kind of
addresses it uses. The default address type is `UUID`, and since some protocols use UUID, it is
recommended to provide custom classes as _subclasses of UUID_.
            
This can be used to for example pass additional data around with an address, for example information
about the location of the node to which the address is assigned. Note that methods equals(), hashCode()
and compare() of the UUID super class should not be changed.

To use custom addresses, an implementation of `org.jgroups.stack.AddressGenerator`
has to be written.

For any class CustomAddress, it will need to get registered with the ClassConfigurator in
order to marshal it correctly:
            
[source,java]
----
class CustomAddress extends UUID {
    static {
        ClassConfigurator.add((short)8900, CustomAddress.class);
    }
}
----


NOTE: Note that the ID should be chosen such that it doesn't collide with any IDs defined in
      `jg-magic-map.xml`.

Set the address generator in `JChannel.setAddressGenerator(AddressGenerator)`. This has to
be done _before_ the channel is connected.
            

An example of a subclass is `org.jgroups.util.PayloadUUID`, and there are two more shipped with JGroups.
            

[[JoiningACluster]]
==== Joining a cluster

When a client wants to join a cluster, it _connects_
to a channel giving the name of the cluster to be joined:


[source,java]
----
public void connect(String cluster) throws Exception;
----

The cluster name is the name of the cluster to be joined. All channels that call `connect()` with
the same name form a cluster. Messages sent on any channel in the cluster will be received by all
members (including the one who sent it).

NOTE: Local delivery can be turned off using `setDiscardOwnMessages(true)`.
            

The `connect()` method returns as soon as the cluster has been joined successfully. If the channel is in
the closed state (see <<ChannelStatesFig, channel states>>), an exception will be thrown. If there are
no other members, i.e. no other member has connected to a cluster with this name, then a new cluster is
created and the member joins it as first member. The first member of a cluster becomes its _coordinator_.
A coordinator is in charge of installing new views whenever the membership changes


[[AtomicJoinAndGetState]]
==== Joining a cluster and getting the state in one operation

Clients can also join a cluster and fetch cluster state _in one operation_.
The best way to conceptualize the connect and fetch state connect method is to think of it as an
invocation of the regular `connect()` and `getState()` methods executed in succession. However, there are
several advantages of using the connect and fetch state connect method over the regular connect. First
of all, the underlying message exchange is heavily optimized, especially if the flush protocol is used.
But more importantly, from a client's perspective, the connect() and fetch state operations become
one atomic operation.
            
[source,java]
----
public void connect(String cluster, Address target, long timeout) throws Exception;
----

Just as in a regular connect(), the cluster name represents a cluster to be joined. The target parameter
indicates a cluster member to fetch the state from. A null target indicates that the state should be
fetched from the cluster coordinator. If the state should be fetched from a particular member other than
the coordinator, clients can simply provide the address of that member. The timeout paremeter bounds
the entire join and fetch operation. An exception will be thrown if the timeout is exceeded.
            

[[GettingAddress]]
==== Getting the local address and the cluster name

Method `getAddress()` returns the address of the channel. The address may or may
not be available when a channel is in the unconnected state.
            
[source,java]
----
public Address getAddress();
----

Method `getClusterName()` returns the name of the cluster which the member joined.

[source,java]
----
public String getClusterName();
----

Again, the result is undefined if the channel is in the disconnected or closed state.
            

[[GettingTheView]]
==== Getting the current view

The following method can be used to get the current view of a channel:


[source,java]
----
public View getView();
----

This method returns the current view of the channel. It is updated every time a new view is
installed (`viewAccepted()` callback).
            
Calling this method on an unconnected or closed channel is implementation defined. A channel may
return null, or it may return the last view it knew of.
            

[[SendingMessages]]
==== Sending messages

Once the channel is connected, messages can be sent using one of the `send()` methods:
            


[source,java]
----
public void send(Message msg) throws Exception;
public void send(Address dst, Object obj) throws Exception;
public void send(Address dst, byte[] buf, int off, int len) throws Exception;
----

The first `send()` method has only one argument, which is the message to be sent.
The message's destination should either be the address of the receiver (unicast) or null (multicast).
When the destination is null, the message will be sent to all members of the cluster (including itself).

The remainaing `send()` methods are helper methods; they take either a `byte[]`
buffer or an object, create a Message and call send(Message).

If the channel is not connected, or was closed, an exception will be thrown upon attempting to send a message.

Here's an example of sending a message to all members of a cluster:
            
[source,java]
----
Map data; // any serializable data
channel.send(null, data);
----

The `null` value as destination address means that the message will be sent to all members in the cluster.
The payload is a hashmap, which will be serialized into the message's buffer and unserialized at the
receiver. Alternatively, any other means of generating a byte buffer and setting the message's buffer
to it (e.g. using `Message.setBuffer()`) also works.
            
Here's an example of sending a unicast message to the first member (coordinator) of a group:
            
[source,java]
----
Address receiver=channel.getView().getMembers().get(0);
channel.send(receiver, "hello world");
----

The sample code determines the coordinator (first member of the view) and sends it a "hello world" message.


===== A note about buffer reuse
The following code is wrong:

[source,java]
----
protected void sendFile() throws Exception {
    FileInputStream in=new FileInputStream(filename);
    byte[] buf=new byte[8096];
    for(;;) {
        int bytes=in.read(buf);
        if(bytes == -1)
            break;
        channel.send(new Message(null, buf, 0, bytes));
    }
}
----

* Buffer `buf` is reused and can get overwritten with new data while JGroups
** queues the message in a bundler and sends multiple messages as a message batch
** possibly retransmits the message if not received by the receiver(s); retransmitting the changed buffer
* Correct: move `buf` into the for loop


[[DiscardingOwnMessages]]
===== Discarding one's own messages

Sometimes, it is desirable not to have to deal with one's own messages, ie. messages sent by oneself.
To do this, `JChannel.setDiscardOwnMessages(boolean flag)` can be set to
true (false by default). This means that every cluster node will receive a message sent
by P, but P itself won't.
                


[[RsvpSection]]
===== Synchronous messages

While JGroups guarantees that a message will eventually be delivered at all non-faulty members,
sometimes this might take a while. For example, if we have a retransmission protocol based on
negative acknowledgments, and the last message sent is lost, then the receiver(s) will have to
wait until the stability protocol notices that the message has been lost, before it can be retransmitted.
                
This can be changed by setting the `Message.RSVP` flag in a message: when this flag is encountered,
the message send blocks until all members have acknowledged reception of the message (of course
excluding members which crashed or left meanwhile).

This also serves as another purpose: if we send an RSVP-tagged message, then - when the send()
returns - we're guaranteed that all messages sent _before_ will have been
delivered at all members as well. So, for example, if P sends message 1-10, and marks 10 as RSVP,
then, upon JChannel.send() returning, P will know that all members received messages 1-10 from P.

Note that since RSVP'ing a message is costly, and might block the sender for a while, it should be
used sparingly. For example, when completing a unit of work (ie. member P sending N messages), and
P needs to know that all messages were received by everyone, then RSVP could be used.

To use RSVP, two things have to be done:

First, the `RSVP` protocol has to be in the config, somewhere above the reliable transmission
protocols such as `NAKACK2` or `UNICAST3`, e.g.:
                
[source,xml]
----
<config>
    <UDP/>
    <PING />
    <FD_ALL/>
    <pbcast.NAKACK2 use_mcast_xmit="true"
                   discard_delivered_msgs="true"/>
    <UNICAST3 timeout="300,600,1200"/>
    <RSVP />
    <pbcast.STABLE stability_delay="1000" desired_avg_gossip="50000"
                   max_bytes="4M"/>
    <pbcast.GMS print_local_addr="true" join_timeout="3000"/>
    ...
</config>
----

Secondly, the message we want to get ack'ed must be marked as `RSVP`:
                
[source,java]
----
Message msg=new Message(null, "hello world").setFlag(Message.RSVP);
ch.send(msg);
----

Here, we send a message to all cluster members (`dest` == null). (Note that RSVP also works for sending
a message to a unicast destination). Method send() will return as soon as it has received acks from
all current members. If there are 4 members A, B, C and D, and A has received acks from itself, B
and C, but D's ack is missing and D crashes before the timeout kicks in, then this will
nevertheless make send() return, as if D had actually sent an ack.
                
If the +timeout+ property is greater than 0, and we don't receive all acks within
timeout milliseconds, a TimeoutException will be thrown (if RSVP.throw_exception_on_timeout is true).
The application can choose to catch this (runtime) exception and do something with it, e.g. retry.
                
The configuration of RSVP is described here: <<RSVP>>.
                
NOTE: RSVP was added in version 3.1.

====== Non blocking RSVP

Sometimes a sender wants a given message to be resent until it has been received, or a timeout occurs, but doesn't want
to block. As an example, `RpcDispatcher.callRemoteMethodsWithFuture()` needs to return immediately, even if the results
aren't available yet. If the call options contain flag `RSVP`, then the future would only be returned once all
responses have been received. This is clearly undesirable behavior.

To solve this, flag `RSVP_NB` (non-blocking) can be used. This has the same behavior as `RSVP`, but the caller is not
blocked by the RSVP protocol. When a timeout occurs, a warning message will be logged, but since the caller doesn't
block, the call won't throw an exception.


[[ReceivingMessages]]
==== Receiving messages

Methods `receive(Message)` and `receive(MessageBatch)` in ReceiverAdapter (or Receiver) can be overridden to
receive messages.

[source,java]
----
public void receive(Message msg);
public void receive(MessageBatch batch);
----

A Receiver can be registered with a channel using `JChannel.setReceiver()`. All received messages, view
changes and state transfer requests will invoke callbacks on the registered Receiver:

[source,java]
----
JChannel ch=new JChannel();
ch.setReceiver(new ReceiverAdapter() {
    public void receive(Message msg) {
        System.out.println("received message " + msg);
    }
    public void viewAccepted(View view) {
        System.out.println("received view " + new_view);
    }
});
ch.connect("MyCluster");
----

NOTE: The semantics of `receive(Message msg)` changed slightly in 4.0: as the buffer of `msg` might get reused by
the transport (to reduce the memory allocation rate), the `receive()` method must consume the buffer
(e.g. de-serialize it into an application object), or make a copy.
As soon as `receive()` returns, the message's buffer might get overwritten with new data.


To receive message batches (see <<MessageBatch>>), method `receive(MessageBatch)` has to be implemented, e.g.:

[source,java]
----
public void receive(MessageBatch batch) {
    for(Message msg: batch) {
        // do something with the message
    }
}
----

Implementing the `receive(MessageBatch)` callback is not strictly necessary, as the default implementation will call
`receive(Message)` for each message of a batch, but it may be more efficient if the application can process batches
of messages in one go.


[[ReceivingViewChanges]]
==== Receiving view changes

As shown above, the `viewAccepted()` callback of ReceiverAdapter can be used
to get callbacks whenever a cluster membership change occurs. The receiver needs to be set via
`JChannel.setReceiver(Receiver)`.

As discussed in <<ReceiverAdapter>>, code in callbacks must avoid anything that takes
a lot of time, or blocks; JGroups invokes this callback as part of the view installation, and if this
user code blocks, the view installation would block, too.
            

[[StateTransfer]]
==== Getting the group's state

A newly joined member may want to retrieve the state of the cluster before starting work. This is done
with `getState()`:
            
[source,java]
----
public void getState(Address target, long timeout) throws Exception;
----

This method returns the state of one member (usually of the oldest member, the coordinator). The target
parameter can usually be null, to ask the current coordinator for the state. If a timeout (ms) elapses
before the state is fetched, an exception will be thrown. A timeout of 0 waits until the entire state
has been transferred.
            
NOTE: The reason for not directly returning the state as a result of
      getState() is that the state has to be returned in the correct position
      relative to other messages. Returning it directly would violate the FIFO properties of a channel,
      and state transfer would not be correct!

To participate in state transfer, both state provider and state requester have to implement the
following callbacks from ReceiverAdapter (Receiver):
            
[source,java]
----
public void getState(OutputStream output) throws Exception;
public void setState(InputStream input) throws Exception;
----

Method `getState()` is invoked on the _state provider_ (usually the coordinator). It
needs to write its state to the output stream given. Note that output doesn't need to be closed when
done (or when an exception is thrown); this is done by JGroups.

The `setState()` method is invoked on the __state requester__; this is the member
which called `JChannel.getState()`. It needs to read its state from the input stream and set its
internal state to it. Note that input doesn't need to be closed when
done (or when an exception is thrown); this is done by JGroups.
            
In a cluster consisting of A, B and C, with D joining the cluster and calling `Channel.getState()`, the
following sequence of callbacks happens:
                
* D calls `JChannel.getState()`. The state will be retrieved from the oldest member, A
* A's `getState()` callback is called. A writes its state to the output stream passed as a
  parameter to `getState()`.
* D's `setState()` callback is called with an input stream as argument. D reads the state from the
  input stream and sets its internal state to it, overriding any previous data.
* D: `JChannel.getState()` returns. Note that this will only happen _after_ the
  state has been transferred successfully, or a timeout elapsed, or either the state provider or
  requester throws an exception. Such an exception will be re-thrown by `getState()`. This could
  happen for instance if the state provider's `getState()` callback tries to stream a
  non-serializable class to the output stream.
                    
The following code fragment shows how a group member participates in state transfers:

[source,java]
----
public void getState(OutputStream output) throws Exception {
    synchronized(state) {
        Util.objectToStream(state, new DataOutputStream(output));
    }
}

public void setState(InputStream input) throws Exception {
    List<String> list;
    list=(List<String>)Util.objectFromStream(new DataInputStream(input));
    synchronized(state) {
        state.clear();
        state.addAll(list);
    }
    System.out.println(list.size() + " messages in chat history):");
    for(String str: list)
        System.out.println(str);
}
----

This code is the Chat example from the JGroups tutorial and the state here is a list of strings.

The `getState()` implementation synchronized on the state (so no incoming messages can modify it during
the state transfer), and uses the JGroups utility method `objectToStream()`.

.Performance when writing to an output stream
****
If a lot of smaller fragments are written to an output stream, it is best to wrap the output stream
into a BufferedOutputStream, e.g. +
[source,java]
----
Util.objectToStream(state,
                    new BufferedOutputStream(new DataOutputStream(output)));
----

****

The `setState()` implementation also uses the `Util.objectFromStream()` utility method to read the state from
the input stream and assign it to its internal list.
            

[[StateTransferProtocols]]
===== State transfer protocols

In order to use state transfer, a state transfer protocol has to be included in the configuration.
This can either be `STATE_TRANSFER`, `STATE`, or `STATE_SOCK`. More details on the protocols can
be found in the <<protlist,protocols list>> section.
                

[[STATE_TRANSFER]]
.STATE_TRANSFER

This is the original state transfer protocol, which used to transfer `byte[]` buffers. It still does
that, but is internally converted to call the `getState()` and `setState()` callbacks which use
input and output streams.

Note that, because `byte[]` buffers are converted into input and output streams, this protocol
should not be used for transfer of large states.
                    
For details see <<pbcast.STATE_TRANSFER>>.
                    

[[STATE]]
.STATE

This is the `STREAMING_STATE_TRANSFER` protocol, renamed in 3.0. It sends the entire state
across from the provider to the requester in (configurable) chunks, so that memory consumption
is minimal.
                    
For details see <<pbcast.STATE>>.
                    

[[STATE_SOCK]]
.STATE_SOCK

Same as `STREAMING_STATE_TRANSFER`, but a TCP connection between provider and requester is
used to transfer the state.
                    
For details see <<pbcast.STATE_SOCK>>.
                    

[[Disconnecting]]
==== Disconnecting from a channel

Disconnecting from a channel is done using the following method:

[source,java]
----
public void disconnect();
----

It will have no effect if the channel is already in the disconnected or closed state. If connected, it
will leave the cluster. This is done (transparently for a channel user) by sending
a leave request to the current coordinator. The latter will subsequently remove the leaving node
from the view and install a new view in all remaining members.
            

After a successful disconnect, the channel will be in the unconnected state, and may subsequently be
reconnected.
            

==== Closing a channel

To destroy a channel instance (destroy the associated protocol stack, and release all resources),
method `close()` is used:
            


[source,java]
----
public void close();
----

Closing a connected channel disconnects the channel first.
            

The close() method moves the channel to the closed state, in which no further operations are allowed
                (most throw an exception when invoked on a closed channel). In this state, a channel instance is not
                considered used any longer by an application and -- when the reference to the instance is reset --
                the channel essentially only lingers around until it is garbage collected by the Java runtime system.
