== List of Protocols

This chapter describes the most frequently used protocols, and their configuration. _Ergonomics_
(<<Ergonomics>>) strives to reduce the number of properties that have to be configured, by
dynamically adjusting them at run time, however, this is not yet in place.
    

Meanwhile, we recommend that users should copy one of the predefined configurations (shipped with JGroups), e.g.
+udp.xml+ or +tcp.xml+, and make only minimal changes to it.

This section is work in progress; we strive to update the documentation as we make changes to the code.
    

[[CommonProps]]
=== Properties availabe in every protocol

The table below lists properties that are available in all protocols, as they're defined in the superclass
of all protocols, org.jgroups.stack.Protocol.

[[Transport]]
=== Transport

`TP` is the base class for all transports, e.g. `UDP` and `TCP`. All of the properties
defined here are inherited by the subclasses. The properties for `TP` are:
        

${TP}

`bind_addr` can be set to the address of a network interface, e.g. +192.168.1.5+.
It can also be set for the entire stack using system property +$$-Djgroups.bind_addr$$+, which
provides a value for bind_addr unless it has already been set in the XML config.
        

The following special values are also recognized for ++$$bind_addr$$++:
        

GLOBAL:: Picks a global IP address if available. If not, falls back to a SITE_LOCAL IP address.

SITE_LOCAL:: Picks a site local (non routable) IP address, e.g. from the +192.168.0.0+ or
             +10.0.0.0+ address range.

LINK_LOCAL:: Picks a link-local IP address, from +169.254.1.0+ through
             +169.254.254.255+.

NON_LOOPBACK:: Picks _any_ non loopback address.
                    
LOOPBACK:: Pick a loopback address, e.g. +127.0.0.1+.

match-interface:: Pick an address which matches a pattern against the interface name,
                  e.g. +match-interface:eth.\*+

match-address:: Pick an address which matches a pattern against the host address,
                e.g. +match-address:192.168.\*+

match-host:: Pick an address which matches a pattern against the host name,
             e.g. +match-host:linux.\*+
                    
An example of setting the bind address in UDP to use a site local address is:
        
[source,xml]
----
<UDP bind_addr="SITE_LOCAL" />
----

This will pick any address of any interface that's site-local, e.g. a +192.168.x.x+ or
+10.x.x.x+ address.
        

[[UDP]]
==== UDP

UDP uses IP multicast for sending messages to all members of a group and UDP datagrams for unicast
messages (sent to a single member). When started, it opens a unicast and multicast socket: the unicast
socket is used to send/receive unicast messages, whereas the multicast socket sends and receives multicast
messages. The channel's physical address will be the address and port number of the unicast socket.
            
A protocol stack with UDP as transport protocol is typically used with clusters whose members run
in the same subnet. If running across subnets, an admin has to ensure that
IP multicast is enabled across subnets. It is often the case that IP multicast is not enabled across
subnets. In such cases, the stack has to either use UDP without IP multicasting or other transports
such as TCP.
            

${UDP}


[[TCP]]
==== TCP

Specifying TCP in your protocol stack tells JGroups to use TCP to send messages between cluster members.
Instead of using a multicast bus, the cluster members create a mesh of TCP connections.
            
For example, while UDP sends 1 IP multicast packet when sending a message to a cluster of 10 members,
TCP needs to send the message 9 times. It sends the same message to the first member, to the second
member, and so on (excluding itself as the message is looped back internally).

This is slow, as the cost of sending a group message is O(n) with TCP, where it is O(1) with UDP. As the
cost of sending a group message with TCP is a function of the cluster size, it becomes higher with
larger clusters.
            

NOTE: We recommend to use UDP for larger clusters, whenever possible


${BasicTCP}

${TCP}


[[TCP_NIO2]]
==== TCP_NIO2

TCP_NIO2 is similar to <<TCP>>, but uses NIO (= Non blocking IO) to send messages to and receive messages
from members. Contrary to TCP, it doesn't use 1 thread per connection, but handles accepts, connects, reads and
writes in a *single thread*.

All of these operations are guaranteed to never block.

For example, if a read is supposed to receive 1000 bytes and only reveived 700, the read reads the 700 bytes, saves
them somewhere and later - when the remaining 300 bytes have been received - is notified to complete the read
and then returns the 1000 bytes to the application.

Using a single thread is not a problem, as operations will never block. The only potentially blocking operation,
namely delivering messages up to the application, is done via the regular or OOB thread pools, as usual.

While <<TCP>> and <<TCP_NIO2>> both have the N-1 problem of sending cluster wide messages (contrary to <<UDP>>),
TCP_NIO2 is able to handle a larger number of connections than TCP, as it doesn't use the thread-per-connection model,
and - contrary to TCP, but similar to UDP - it doesn't block when sending or receiving messages.

[[DiscoveryProtocols]]
=== Initial membership discovery

The task of the discovery is to find an initial membership, which is used to determine the current
coordinator. Once a coordinator is found, the joiner sends a JOIN request to the coord.

Discovery is also called periodically by `MERGE2` (see <<MERGE2>>), to see if we have
diverging cluster membership information.
        

[[Discovery]]
==== Discovery

`Discovery` is the superclass for all discovery protocols and therefore its
properties below can be used in any subclass.

Discovery sends a discovery request, and waits for +$$num_initial_members$$+ discovery
responses, or +timeout+ ms, whichever occurs first, before returning. Note that
+$$break_on_coord_rsp="true"$$+ will return as soon as we have a response from a coordinator.
            

${Discovery}

[[DiscoveryAndCaches]]
===== Discovery and local caches

Besides finding the current coordinator in order to send a JOIN request to it, discovery also
fetches information about members and adds it to its local caches. This information includes
the logical name, UUID and IP address/port of each member. When discovery responses are received,
the information in it will be added to the local caches.
                

Since 3.5 it is possible to define this information in a single file, with each line providing
information about one member. The file contents look like this:


----
m1.1 1 10.240.78.26:7800   T
m2.1 2 10.240.122.252:7800 F
m3.1 3 10.240.199.15:7800  F
----

This file defines information about 3 members m1.1, m2.1 and m3.1. The first element ("m1.1") is the
logical name. Next comes the UUID (1), followed by the IP address and port (`10.240.78.26:7800`).
T means that the member is the current coordinator.
                
Methods `dumpCache()` can be used to write the current contents of any member to a file (in the above
format) and `addToCache()` can be used to add the contents of a file to any member. These operations
can for example be invoked via JMX or probe.sh.
                
Refer to the section on `FILE_PING` for more information on how to use these files to speed up
the discovery process.
                

[[PING]]
==== PING

Initial (dirty) discovery of members. Used to detect the coordinator (oldest member), by
mcasting PING requests to an IP multicast address.
            
Each member responds with a packet {C, A}, where C=coordinator's address and A=own address. After N
milliseconds or M replies, the joiner determines the coordinator from the responses, and sends a
JOIN request to it (handled by GMS). If nobody responds, we assume we are the first member of a group.
            
Unlike TCPPING, PING employs dynamic discovery, meaning that the member does not have to know in advance
where other cluster members are.
            
PING uses the IP multicasting capabilities of the transport to send a discovery
request to the cluster. It therefore requires UDP as transport.
            

${PING}


[[TCPPING_Prot]]
==== TCPPING

TCPPING is used with TCP as transport, and uses a static list of cluster members's addresses. See
<<TCPPING>> for details.
            

${TCPPING}

NOTE: It is recommended to include the addresses of _all_ cluster members in `initial_hosts`.
                


[[TCPGOSSIP_Prot]]
==== TCPGOSSIP

TCPGOSSIP uses an external GossipRouter to discover the members of a cluster. See <<TCPGOSSIP>>
for details.
            

${TCPGOSSIP}

[[MPING]]
==== MPING

MPING (=Multicast PING) uses IP multicast to discover the initial membership. It can be used with all
transports, but usually is used in combination with TCP. TCP usually requires TCPPING, which has to list
all cluster members explicitly, but MPING doesn't have this requirement. The typical use case for this
is when we want TCP as transport, but multicasting for discovery so we don't have to define a static
list of initial hosts in TCPPING
            
MPING uses its own multicast socket for discovery. Properties +$$bind_addr$$+ (can also
be set via ++$$-Djgroups.bind_addr=$$++), +$$mcast_addr$$+ and
+$$mcast_port$$+ can be used to configure it.
            
Note that MPING requires a separate thread listening on the multicast socket for discovery requests.
            

${MPING}

[[FILE_PING]]
==== FILE_PING

FILE_PING can be used instead of GossipRouter in cases where no external process is desired.
            

Since 3.5, the way FILE_PING performs discovery has changed. The following paragraphs describe the new
mechanism to discover members via FILE_PING or subclasses (e.g. S3_PING or GOOGLE_PING),
so this applies to all cloud-based stores as well.
            
Instead of storing 1 file per member in the file system or cloud store, we only store 1 file for
_all_ members. This has the advantage, especially in cloud stores, that the number
of reads is not a function of the cluster size, e.g. we don't have to perform 1000 reads for member
discovery in a 1000 node cluster, but just a single read. This is important as the cost of
1000 times the round trip time of a (REST) call to the cloud store is certainly higher that the cost
of a single call. There may also be a charge for calls to the cloud, so a reduced number of calls lead
to reduced charges for cloud store access, especially in large clusters.


The current coordinator is always in charge of writing the file; participants never write it, but only
read it. When there is a split and we have multiple coordinator, we may also have multiple files.
            

The name of a file is always UUID.logical_name.list, e.g. `0000-0000-000000000001.m1.1.list`, which has
a UUID of 1, a logical name of "m1.1" and the suffix ".list".
            

[[BootstrapConfiguration]]
===== Configuration with a preconfigured bootstrap file

To speed up the discovery process when starting a large cluster, a predefined bootstrap file
can be used. Every node then needs to have an entry in the file and its UUID and IP address:port
needs to be the same as in the file. For example, when using the following bootstrap file:


----
m1.1 1 10.240.78.26:7800   T
m2.1 2 10.240.122.252:7800 F
m3.1 3 10.240.199.15:7800  F
----

, the member called "m1.1" needs to have a UUID of 1, and needs to run on host 10.240.78.26 on
port 7800. The UUID can be injected via an AddressGenerator (see UPerf for an example).
                
When a member starts, it loads the bootstrap file, which contains information about all other members,
and thus (ideally) never needs to run a discovery process. In the above example, the new joiner also
knows that the current coordinator (marked with a 'T') is m1.1, so it can send its JOIN request to
that node.
                
When the coordinator changes, or members not listed in the file join, the current coordinator
writes the file again, so all members have access to the updated information when needed.

If a bootstrap discovery file is to be used, it needs to be placed into the file system or cloud
store in the correct location and with the right name (see the Discovery section for naming details).

The design is discussed in more detail in
link:$$https://github.com/belaban/JGroups/blob/master/doc/design/CloudBasedDiscovery.txt$$[CloudBasedDiscovery.txt]


===== Removal of zombie files

By default, a new coordinator C never removes a file created by an old coordinator `A`. E.g. in `{A,B,C,D}` (with
coordinator `A`), if `C` becomes coordinator on a split `{A,B} | {C,D}`, then `C` doesn't remove `A`'s file, as there
is no way for `C` to know whether `A` crashed or whether `A` was partitioned away.

Every coordinator `P` installs a shutdown hook which removes `P`'s file on termination. However, this doesn't apply
to a process killed ungracefully, e.g. by `kill -9`. In this case, no shutdown hook will get called. If we had view
`{A,B,C}`, and `A` was killed via kill -9, and `B` takes over, we'd have files `A.list` and `B.list`.

To change this, attribute `remove_old_coords_on_view_change` can be set to true. In this case, files created by old
coordinators will be removed. In the scenario above, where `A` crashed, `B` would remove `A.list`.

However, if we have a split between `{A,B}` and `{C,D}`, `C` would remove `A.list`. To prevent this, every coordinator
writes its file again on a view change that has left members or in which the coordinator changed.

There is still a case which can end up with a zombie file that's never removed: when we have a single member `A` and
it is killed via `kill -9`. In this case, file `A.list` will never get cleaned up and subsequent joiners will ask
`A` to join, up to `GMS.max_join_attempts` times.

Zombie cleanup can be solved by setting `remove_all_files_on_view_change` to true. In this case, a coordinator
removes _all files_ on a view change that has members leaving or changes the coordinator.

NOTE: Setting `remove_old_coords_on_view_change` or `remove_all_files_on_view_change` to true generates more traffic
to the file system or cloud store. If members are always shut down gracefully, or never killed via `kill -9`, then
it is recommended to set both attributes to false.


${FILE_PING}



==== JDBC_PING

JDBC_PING uses a DB to store information about cluster nodes used for discovery. All cluster nodes are supposed to be
able to access the same DB.

When a node starts, it queries information about existing members from the database, determines the coordinator and
then asks the coord to join the cluster. It also inserts information about itself into the table, so others can
subsequently find it.

When a node P has crashed, the current coordinator removes P's information from the DB. However, if there is a network
split, then this can be problematic, as crashed members cannot be told from partitioned-away members.

For instance, if we have `{A,B,C,D}`, and the split creates 2 subclusters `{A,B}` and `{C,D}`,
then `A` would remove `{C,D}` because it thinks they crashed, and - likewise - `C` would remove `{A,B}`.

To solve this, every member re-inserts its information into the DB after a _view change_. So when `C` and `D`'s view
changes from `{A,B,C,D}` to `{C,D}`, both sides of the split re-insert their information.
Ditto for the other side of the network split.

The re-insertion is governed by attributes `info_writer_max_writes_after_view` and `info_writer_sleep_time`: the former
defines the number of times re-insertion should be done (in a timer task) after each view change and the latter is the
sleep time (in ms) between re-insertions.

The value of this is that dead members are removed from the DB (because they cannot do re-insertion), but network splits
are handled, too.

Another attribute `clear_table_on_view_change` governs how zombies are handled. Zombies are table entries for members
which crashed, but weren't removed for some reason. E.g. if we have a single member `A` and kill it (via kill -9), then
it won't get removed from the table.

If `clear_table_on_view_change` is set to true, then the coordinator _clears_ the table after a view change (instead of
only removing the crashed members), and everybody re-inserts its own information. This attribute can be set to true if
automatic removal of zombies is desired. However, it is costly, therefore if no zombies ever occur (e.g. because processes
are never killed with kill -9), or zombies are removed by a system admin, then it should be set to false.

NOTE: Processes killed with kill -3 are removed from the DB as a shutdown handler will be called on kill -3
(but not on kill -9).
            

${JDBC_PING}



==== BPING

BPING uses UDP broadcasts to discover other nodes. The default broadcast address (dest) is
                255.255.255.255, and should be replaced with a subnet specific broadcast, e.g. 192.168.1.255.
            

${BPING}



==== RACKSPACE_PING

RACKSPACE_PING uses Rackspace Cloud Files Storage to discover initial members. Each node writes a small
                object in a shared Rackspace container. New joiners read all addresses from the container and ping each
                of the elements of the resulting set of members. When a member leaves, it deletes its corresponding object.
            

This objects are stored under a container called 'jgroups', and each node will write an object name after
                the cluster name, plus a "/" followed by the address, thus simulating a hierarchical structure.
            

${RACKSPACE_PING}



==== S3_PING

S3_PING uses Amazon S3 to discover initial members. New joiners read all addresses
from this bucket and ping each of the elements of the resulting set of members. When a member leaves, it
deletes its corresponding file.
            

It's designed specifically for members running on Amazon EC2, where multicast traffic is not allowed and
thus MPING or PING will not work. When Amazon RDS is preferred over S3, or if a shared database is used,
an alternative is to use JDBC_PING.
            

Each instance uploads a small file to an S3 bucket and each instance reads the files out of this bucket
to determine the other members.
            

There are three different ways to use S3_PING, each having its own tradeoffs between security and
ease-of-use. These are described in more detail below:

* Private buckets, Amazon AWS credentials given to each instance
* Public readable and writable buckets, no credentials given to each instance
* Public readable but private writable buckets, pre-signed URLs given to each instance
  Pre-signed URLs are the most secure method since writing to buckets still requires authorization and
  you don't have to pass Amazon AWS credentials to every instance. However, they are also the most complex
  to setup.
            

Here's a configuration example for private buckets with credentials given to each instance:
            


[source,xml]
----

<S3_PING location="my_bucket" access_key="access_key"
         secret_access_key="secret_access_key" timeout="2000"
         num_initial_members="3"/>
            
----

Here's an example for public buckets with no credentials:
            


[source,xml]
----

<S3_PING location="my_bucket"
         timeout="2000" num_initial_members="3"/>
            
----

And finally, here's an example for public readable buckets with pre-signed URLs:
            


[source,xml]
----

<S3_PING pre_signed_put_url="http://s3.amazonaws.com/my_bucket/DemoCluster/node1?AWSAccessKeyId=access_key&Expires=1316276200&Signature=it1cUUtgCT9ZJyCJDj2xTAcRTFg%3D"
         pre_signed_delete_url="http://s3.amazonaws.com/my_bucket/DemoCluster/node1?AWSAccessKeyId=access_key&Expires=1316276200&Signature=u4IFPRq%2FL6%2FAohykIW4QrKjR23g%3D"
         timeout="2000" num_initial_members="3"/>
            
----

${S3_PING}



==== AWS_PING

This is a protocol written by Meltmedia, which uses the AWS API. It is not part of JGroups, but can be
downloaded at link:$$http://meltmedia.github.io/jgroups-aws/$$[].


==== Native S3 PING

This implementation by Zalando uses the AWS SDK. It is not part of JGroups, but can be found at
link:$$https://github.com/zalando/jgroups-native-s3-ping/$$[].



==== GOOGLE_PING

GOOGLE_PING is a subclass of S3_PING and inherits most of the functionality. It uses Google Cloud
                Storage to store information about individual members.
            

The snippet below shows a sample config:
            


[source,xml]
----

<GOOGLE_PING
           location="jgroups-bucket"
           access_key="GXXXXXX"
           secret_access_key="YYYYYY"
           timeout="2000" num_initial_members="3"/>
            
----

This will use a bucket "jgroups-bucket" or create one if it doesn't exist, then create another folder
                under it with the cluster name, and finally use 1 object per member in that location for member info.
            

${GOOGLE_PING}



==== SWIFT_PING

SWIFT_PING uses Openstack Swift to discover initial members. Each node writes a small
                object in a shared container. New joiners read all addresses from the container and ping each
                of the elements of the resulting set of members. When a member leaves, it deletes its corresponding object.
            

These objects are stored under a container called 'jgroups' (by default), and each node will write an object name after
                the cluster name, plus a "/" followed by the address, thus simulating a hierarchical structure.
            

Currently only Openstack Keystone authentication is supported. Here is a sample configuration block:
            


[source,xml]
----

<SWIFT_PING timeout="2000"
    num_initial_members="3"
    auth_type="keystone_v_2_0"
    auth_url="http://localhost:5000/v2.0/tokens"
    username="demo"
    password="password"
    tenant="demo" />
            
----

${SWIFT_PING}





==== PDC - Persistent Discovery Cache

The Persistent Discovery Cache can be used to cache the results of the discovery process persistently.
E.g. if we have TCPPING.initial_hosts configured to include only members A and B, but have a lot more
members, then other members can bootstrap themselves and find the right coordinator even when neither
A nor B are running.
            

An example of a TCP-based stack configuration is:
            


[source,xml]
----

<TCP />
<PDC cache_dir="/tmp/jgroups"  />
<TCPPING timeout="2000" num_initial_members="20"
         initial_hosts="192.168.1.5[7000]" port_range="0"
         return_entire_cache="true"
         use_disk_cache="true" />
            
----

${PDC}



=== Merging after a network partition

[[MERGE2]]
==== MERGE2

If a cluster gets split for some reasons (e.g. network partition), this protocol merges the subclusters
back into one cluster. It is only run by the coordinator (the oldest member in a cluster), which
periodically multicasts its presence and view information. If another coordinator (for the same cluster)
receives this message, it will initiate a merge process. Note that this merges subgroups
+{A,B}+ and +{C,D,E}+ back into +{A,B,C,D,E}+,
but it does _not merge state_. The application has to handle the  callback to merge
state. See <<HandlingNetworkPartitions>> for suggestion on merging states.

Following a merge, the coordinator of the merged group can shift from the typical case of
"the coordinator is the member who has been up the longest."  During the merge process, the coordinators
of the various subgroups need to reach a common decision as to who the new coordinator is.
In order to ensure a consistent result, each coordinator combines the addresses of all the members
in a list and then sorts the list. The first member in the sorted list becomes the coordinator.
The sort order is determined by how the address implements the interface. Then JGroups  compares based
on the UUID. So, take a hypothetical case where two machines were running, with one machine running
three separate cluster members and the other two members. If communication between the machines were cut,
the following subgroups would form:
+{A,B} and {C,D,E}+
Following the merge, the new view would be: +{C,D,A,B,E}+, with C being the new
coordinator.
            

Note that "A", "B" and so on are just logical names, attached to UUIDs, but the actual sorting is done
                on the actual UUIDs.
            
${MERGE2}

NOTE: `MERGE2` is deprecated and will be removed in 4.0. Users of it should switch to `MERGE3`.



[[MERGE3]]
==== MERGE3

If a cluster gets split for some reasons (e.g. network partition), this protocol merges the subclusters
back into one cluster.

All members periodically send an INFO message with their address (UUID), logical name,
physical address and ViewId. The ViewId (<<ViewId>>) is used to see if we have diverging
views among the cluster members: periodically, every coordinator looks at the INFO messages received so
far and checks if there are any inconsistencies.

If inconsistencies are found, the _merge leader_ will be the member with the lowest address (UUID).

The merge leader then asks the senders of the inconsistent ViewIds for their full views. Once received,
it simply passes a `MERGE` event up the stack, where the merge will be handled (by `GMS`) in exactly the same
way as if `MERGE2` has generated the `MERGE` event.

The advantages of `MERGE3` compared to `MERGE2` are:

* Sending of INFO messages is spread out over time, preventing message peaks which might cause
  packet loss. This is especially important in large clusters.
* Only 1 merge should be running at any time. Competing merges, as happening with `MERGE2`, slow
  down the merge process, and don't scale to large clusters.
* An INFO message carries the logical name and physical address of a member. Compared to `MERGE2`,
  this allows us to immediately send messages to newly merged members, and not have to solicit
  this information first.
* On the downside, `MERGE3` has constant (small) traffic by all members.
* `MERGE3` was written for an IP multicast capable transport (`UDP`), but it also works with other
  transports (such as `TCP`), although it isn't as efficient on `TCP` as on `UDP`.


===== Example

[source,xml]
----
<MERGE3 max_interval="10000" min_interval="5000" check_interval="15000"/>
----

This means that every member sends out an INFO message at a random interval in range [5000 .. 10000] ms. Every
15 seconds (`check_interval`), every coordinator checks if it received a ViewId differing from its own, and initiates
a merge if true.

* We have subclusters `{A,B,C}`, `{D,E}` and `{F}`. The subcluster coordinators are `A`, `D` and `F`
* The network partition now heals
* `D` checks its received ViewIds, and sees entries from itself and `A`
** Since broadcasting of INFO messages is unreliable (as `MERGE3` is underneath `NAKACK2` in the stack), the last
   INFO message from `F` might have been dropped
* `D` or `A` initiates a merge, which results in view `{A,B,C,D,E}`
* A bit later, on the next check, `F` sees that its ViewId diverges from the ViewId sent in an INFO message by `C`
* `F` and `A` initiate a new merge which results in merge view `{A,B,C,D,E,F}`

Increasing `check_interval` decreases the chance of partial merges (as shown above), but doesn't entirely eliminate them:
members are not started at exactly the same time, and therefore their check intervals overlap.
If a member's interval elapsed just after receiving INFO messages from a subset of the subclusters
(e.g. briefly after a partition healed), then we will still have a partial merge.

${MERGE3}






[[FailureDetection]]
=== Failure Detection

The task of failure detection is to probe members of a group and see whether they are alive. When a member is
suspected of having failed, then a SUSPECT message is sent to all nodes of the cluster. It is not the task of the
failure detection layer to exclude a crashed member (this is done by the group membership protocol, GMS), but
simply to notify everyone that a node in the cluster is suspected of having crashed.

The SUSPECT message is handled by the GMS protocol of the current coordinator only; all other members ignore it.
        

[[FD]]
==== FD

Failure detection based on a logical ring and heartbeat messages.

Members form a logical ring; e.g. in view `{A,B,C,D}`, `A` pings `B`, which pings `C`, which pings `D`, which pings `A`.
'Pinging' means sending a heartbeat.

Each member sends this heartbeat every `timeout` ms to the neighbor to its right. When a member receives a heartbeat, it
sends back an ack. When the ack is received the timestamp of when a member last heard from its neighbor is reset.

When a member doesn't receive any heartbeat acks from its neighbor for `timeout` * `max_tries` ms,
that member is declared suspected, and will be excluded by GMS.

This is done by `FD` multicasting a `SUSPECT(P)` message which is handled by the current coordinator by double-checking
the health of `P` (using `VERIFY_SUSPECT`) and - if `P` still doesn't reply - by excluding `P` from the membership.

Note that setting `msg_counts_as_heartbeat` in `P` to true causes the timestamp of `P` in the pinging member to be
reset.

===== Example

[source,xml]
----
<FD timeout="3000" max_tries="4" />
----
* The membership is `{A,B,C,D,E}`.
* Now C and D crash at the same time
* B's next heartbeats won't get an ack
* After roughly 12 seconds (4 * 3 secs), B suspects C
** B now starts sending heartbeats to D
* A (the coordinator) handles the `SUSPECT(C)` message from B and uses `VERIFY_SUSPECT` to double-check that C is really dead
* After `VERIFY_SUSPECT.timeout` ms, A creates a new view `{A,B,D,E}` excluding C
* After ca. 12 seconds, B sends a `SUSPECT(D)` message to the coordinator, which eventually also excludes `D`



${FD}



[[FD_ALL]]
==== FD_ALL

Failure detection based on simple heartbeat protocol. Every member periodically multicasts a heartbeat.
Every member also maintains a table of all members (minus itself). When data or a heartbeat from P are
received, we reset the timestamp for P to the current time.
Periodically, we check for expired members whose timestamp is greater than the timeout, and suspect those.

===== Example

[source,xml]
----
<FD_ALL timeout="12000" interval="3000" timeout_check_interval="2000"/>
----
* The membership is `{A,B,C,D,E}`.
* Every member broadcasts a heartbeat every 3 seconds. When received, the sender's timestamp in the table
  is set to the current time
* Every member also checks every 2 seconds if any member's timestamp exceeds the timeout and suspects
  that member if this is the case
* Now C and D crash at the same time
* After roughly 12-13 seconds, `A`, `B` and `E` broadcast a `SUSPECT(C,D)` message
* The coordinator (`A`) uses `VERIFY_SUSPECT` to double check if `C` and `D` are dead
* `A` creates a new view `{A,B,E}` which excludes `C` and `D`

NOTE: Contrary to `FD` which suspects adjacent crashed members `C` and `D` one by one, `FD_ALL` suspects `C` and `D` in
constant time. `FD` takes `N` * (`timeout` * `max_tries`) ms, whereas `FD_ALL` takes `timeout` ms

${FD_ALL}



[[FD_ALL2]]
==== FD_ALL2

Similar to `FD_ALL`, but doesn't use any timestamps. Instead, a boolean flag is associated with each
member. When a message or heartbeat (sent every `interval` ms) from P is received, P's flag is set to true.
The heartbeat checker checks every `timeout` ms for members whose flag is false, suspects those, and
- when done - resets all flags to false again.
The times it takes to suspect a member are the same as for `FD_ALL`
            

${FD_ALL2}



[[FD_SOCK]]
==== FD_SOCK

Failure detection protocol based on a ring of TCP sockets created between cluster members, similar to `FD` but
not using heartbeat messages.

Each member in a cluster connects to its neighbor (the last member connects to the first), thus forming a ring.
Member `B` is suspected when its neighbor `A` detects abnormal closing of its TCP socket
(presumably due to a crash of `B`). However, if `B` is about to leave gracefully, it lets its neighbor `A`
know, so that `A` doesn't suspect `B`.
            
===== Example
* The membership is `{A,B,C,D,E}`.
* Members `C` and `D` are killed at the same time
* `B` notices that `C` abnormally closed its TCP socket and broadcasts a `SUSPECT(C)` message
* The current coordinator (`A`) asks `VERIFY_SUSPECT` to double check that `C` is dead
* Meanwhile, `B` tries to create a TCP socket to the next-in-line (`D`) but fails. It therefore broadcasts a
  `SUSPECT(D)` message
* `A` also handles this message and asks `VERIFY_SUSPECT` to double check if `D` is dead
* After `VERIFY_SUSPECT` can't verify that `C` and `D` are still alive, `A` creates a new view
  `{A,B,E}` and installs it
* The time taken for `FD_SOCK` to suspect a member is very small (a few ms)

NOTE: It is recommended to use `FD_SOCK` and `FD` or `FD_ALL` together in the same stack: `FD_SOCK` detects killed
nodes immediately, and `FD_ALL` (with a higher timeout) detects hung members or kernel panics / crashed switches
(which don't close the TCP connection) after the timeout.
            

${FD_SOCK}


[[FD_HOST]]
==== FD_HOST

To detect the crash or freeze of entire hosts and all of the cluster members running on them, `FD_HOST`
can be used. It is not meant to be used in isolation, as it doesn't detect crashed members on the
local host, but in conjunction with other failure detection protocols, such as `FD_ALL` or `FD_SOCK`.

`FD_HOST` can be used when we have multiple cluster members running on a physical box. For example,
if we have members `{A,B,C,D}` running on host 1 and `{M,N,O,P}` running on host 2, and host 1 is
powered down, then `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` are suspected and removed from the cluster together, typically
in one view change.

By default, `FD_HOST` uses `InetAddress.isReachable()` to perform liveness checking of other hosts, but
if property `cmd` is set, then any script or command can be used. `FD_HOST` will launch the command and
pass the IP address ot the host to be checked as argument. Example: `cmd="ping -c 3"`.

A typical failure detection configuration would look like this:

[source,xml]
----
...
<FD_SOCK/>
<FD_ALL timeout="60000" interval="20000"/>
<FD_HOST interval="10000" timeout="35000" />
...
----

If we have members `{A,B,C}` on host `192.168.1.3`, `{M,N,O}` on `192.168.1.4` and `{X,Y,Z}` on `192.168.1.5`, then
the behavior is as follows:

.Failure detection behavior
[options="header"]
|===============
|Scenario|Behavior
|Any member (say `O`) crashes|
                               `FD_SOCK` detects this immediately (as the TCP socket was closed). `O` is suspected and
                                removed
                            
|Member `Y` hangs|
                                `FD_ALL` starts missing heartbeats from `Y` (note that host `192.168.1.5` is up) and suspects
                                `Y` after 60 seconds. `Y` is removed from the view.
                            
|Host `192.168.1.3` is shutdown (`shutdown -h now`)|
                                Since this is a graceful shutdown, the OS closes all sockets. `FD_SOCK` therefore
                                suspects `A`, `B` and `C` and removes them from the view immediately.
                            
|The power supply to host `192.168.1.3` is cut, or `192.168.1.3` panicked|
                                `FD_HOST` detects that `192.168.1.3` is not alive and suspects `A`, `B` and `C` after ~35 to 45s.
                            
|Member `N` leaves|
                                Since this is a graceful leave, none of the failure detection protocols kick in
                            

|===============


${FD_HOST}



==== VERIFY_SUSPECT

Verifies that a suspected member is really dead by pinging that member one last time before excluding it,
                and dropping the suspect message if the member does respond.
            

VERIFY_SUSPECT tries to minimize false suspicions.
            

The protocol works as follows: it catches SUSPECT events traveling up the stack.
                Then it verifies that the suspected member is really dead. If yes, it passes the SUSPECT event up the
                stack, otherwise it discards it. VERIFY_SUSPECT Has to be placed somewhere above the failure detection
                protocol and below the GMS protocol (receiver of the SUSPECT event). Note that SUSPECT events may be
                reordered by this protocol.
            

${VERIFY_SUSPECT}



[[ReliableMessageTransmission]]


=== Reliable message transmission

[[NAKACK]]


==== pbcast.NAKACK

NAKACK provides reliable delivery and FIFO (= First In First Out) properties for messages sent to all
                nodes in a cluster.
            

Reliable delivery means that no message sent by a sender will ever be lost, as all messages are
numbered with sequence numbers (by sender) and retransmission requests are sent to the sender of
a message if that sequence number is not received.

NOTE: Note that NAKACK can also be configured to send retransmission requests for M to _anyone_ in the cluster,
     rather than only to the sender of M.


FIFO order means that all messages from a given sender are received in exactly the order in which
                they were sent.
            

NAKACK is a Lossless and FIFO delivery of multicast messages, using negative acks. E.g. when
                receiving P:1, P:3, P:4, a receiver delivers only P:1, and asks P for retransmission of message 2,
                queuing P3-4. When P2 is finally received, the receiver will deliver P2-4 to the application.
            

${NAKACK}

[[NAKACK2]]


==== NAKACK2

NAKACK2 was introduced in 3.1 and is a successor to NAKACK (at some point it will replace NAKACK). It
                has the same properties as NAKACK, but its implementation is faster and uses less memory, plus it
                creates fewer tasks in the timer.
            

Some of the properties of NAKACK were deprecated in NAKACK2, but were not removed so people can simply
                change from NAKACK to NAKACK2 by changing the protocol name in the config.
            

${NAKACK2}

[[UNICAST]]


==== UNICAST

UNICAST provides reliable delivery and FIFO (= First In First Out) properties for point-to-point
                messages between one sender and one receiver.
            

Reliable delivery means that no message sent by a sender will ever be lost, as all messages are
                numbered with sequence numbers (by sender) and retransmission requests are sent to the sender of
                a message if that sequence number is not received.
            

FIFO order means that all messages from a given sender are received in exactly the order in which
                they were sent.
            

UNICAST uses _positive acks_ for retransmission; sender A keeps sending
                message M until receiver B delivers M and sends an ack(M) to A, or until B leaves the cluster or A
                crashes.
            

Although JGroups attempts to send acks selectively, UNICAST will still see a lot of acks on the wire.
                If this is not desired, use UNICAST2 (see <<UNICAST2>>).
            

On top of a reliable transport, such as TCP, UNICAST is not really needed. However, concurrent
                delivery of messages from the same sender is prevented by UNICAST by acquiring a lock on the sender's
                retransmission table, so unless concurrent delivery is desired, UNICAST should not be removed from
                the stack even if TCP is used.
            

${UNICAST}

[[UNICAST2]]


==== UNICAST2

UNICAST2 provides lossless, ordered, communication between 2 members. Contrary to UNICAST, it
                uses _negative acks_ (similar to NAKACK) rather than positive acks. This reduces the communication
                overhead required for sending an ack for every message.
            

Negative acks have sender A simply send messages without retransmission, and receivers never ack
                messages, until they detect a gap: for instance, if A sends messages 1,2,4,5, then B delivers 1 and 2,
                but queues 4 and 5 because it is missing message 3 from A. B then asks A to retransmit 3. When 3 is
                received, messages 3, 4 and 5 can be delivered to the application.
            

Compared to a positive ack scheme as used in UNICAST, negative acks have the advantage that they generate
                less traffic: if all messages are received in order, we never need to do retransmission.
            

${UNICAST2}

[[UNICAST3]]


==== UNICAST3

UNICAST3 (available in 3.3) is the successor to UNICAST2, but is based on UNICAST, as it uses a
                positive acknowledgment mechanism. However, speed wise it is similar to UNICAST2
            

Details of UNICAST3's design can be found here:
                link:$$https://github.com/belaban/JGroups/blob/master/doc/design/UNICAST3.txt$$[UNICAST3]
            

${UNICAST3}

[[RSVP]]


==== RSVP

The RSVP protocol is not a reliable delivery protocol per se, but augments reliable protocols such
                as NAKACK, UNICAST or UNICAST2. It should be placed somewhere _above_ these in
                the stack.
            

${RSVP}

[[STABLE]]


=== Message stability

To serve potential retransmission requests, a member has to store received messages until it is known
            that every member in the cluster has received them. Message stability for a given message M means that M
            has been seen by everyone in the cluster.
        

The stability protocol periodically (or when a certain number of bytes have been received) initiates a
            consensus protocol, which multicasts a stable message containing the highest message numbers for a
            given member. This is called a digest.
        

When everyone has received everybody else's stable messages, a digest is computed which consists of the
            minimum sequence numbers of all received digests so far. This is the stability vector, and contain only
            message sequence numbers that have been seen by everyone.
        

This stability vector is the broadcast to the group and everyone can remove messages from their
            retransmission tables whose sequence numbers are smaller than the ones received in the stability vector.
            These messages can then be garbage collected.
        



==== STABLE

STABLE garbage collects messages that have been seen by all members of a cluster. Each member has to
                store all messages because it may be asked to retransmit. Only when we are sure that all members have
                seen a message can it be removed from the retransmission buffers. STABLE periodically gossips its
                highest and lowest messages seen. The lowest value is used to compute the min (all lowest seqnos
                for all members), and messages with a seqno below that min can safely be discarded.
            

Note that STABLE can also be configured to run when N bytes have been received. This is recommended
                when sending messages at a high rate, because sending stable messages based on time might accumulate
                messages faster than STABLE can garbage collect them.
            

${STABLE}

[[GMS]]


=== Group Membership

Group membership takes care of joining new members, handling leave
            requests by existing members, and handling SUSPECT messages for crashed
            members, as emitted by failure detection protocols. The algorithm for
            joining a new member is essentially:
        


----

- loop
- find initial members (discovery)
- if no responses:
    - become singleton group and break out of the loop
- else:
    - determine the coordinator (oldest member) from the responses
    - send JOIN request to coordinator
    - wait for JOIN response
    - if JOIN response received:
        - install view and break out of the loop
    - else
        - sleep for 5 seconds and continue the loop
        
----



==== pbcast.GMS

${GMS}



===== Joining a new member

Consider the following situation: a new member wants to join a
                    group. The prodedure to do so is:
                

* Multicast an (unreliable) discovery request (ping)
* Wait for n responses or m milliseconds (whichever is first)
* Every member responds with the address of the coordinator
* If the initial responses are &gt; 0: determine the coordinator and start the JOIN protocol
* If the initial response are 0: become coordinator, assuming that no one else is out there

However, the problem is that the initial mcast discovery request
might get lost, e.g. when multiple members start at the same time, the
outgoing network buffer might overflow, and the mcast packet might get
dropped. Nobody receives it and thus the sender will not receive any
responses, resulting in an initial membership of 0. This could result in
multiple coordinators, and multiple subgroups forming. How can we overcome
this problem ? There are two solutions:

. Increase the timeout, or number of responses received. This will
  only help if the reason of the empty membership was a slow host. If
  the mcast packet was dropped, this solution won't help
. Add the MERGE2 or MERGE3 protocol. This doesn't actually prevent
  multiple initial cordinators, but rectifies the problem by merging
  different subgroups back into one. Note that this might involve state
  merging which needs to be done by the application.
                        


[[FlowControl]]
=== Flow control

Flow control takes care of adjusting the rate of a message sender to the rate of the slowest receiver over time.
            If a sender continuously sends messages at a rate that is faster than the receiver(s), the receivers will
            either queue up messages, or the messages will get discarded by the receiver(s), triggering costly
            retransmissions. In addition, there is spurious traffic on the cluster, causing even more retransmissions.
        

Flow control throttles the sender so the receivers are not overrun with messages.
        

Note that flow control can be bypassed by setting message flag Message.NO_FC. See <<MessageFlags>>
            for details.
        

The properties for FlowControl are shown below and can be used in
            MFC and UFC:
        

${FlowControl}



==== FC

FC uses a credit based system, where each sender has +$$max_credits$$+ credits and decrements
                them whenever a message is sent. The sender blocks when the credits fall below 0, and only resumes
                sending messages when it receives a replenishment message from the receivers.
            

The receivers maintain a table of credits for all senders and decrement the given sender's credits
                as well, when a message is received.
            

When a sender's credits drops below a threshold, the receiver will send a replenishment message to
                the sender. The threshold is defined by +$$min_bytes$$+ or +$$min_threshold$$+.
            

${FC}


NOTE: FC has been deprecated, use MFC and UFC instead


==== MFC and UFC

In 2.10, FC was separated into MFC (Multicast Flow Control) and Unicast Flow Control (UFC). The reason
                was that multicast flow control should not be impeded by unicast flow control, and vice versa. Also,
                performance for the separate implementations could be increased, plus they can be individually omitted.
                For example, if no unicast flow control is needed, UFC can be left out of the stack configuration.
            

[[MFC]]

MFC has currently no properties other than those inherited by
                    FlowControl (see above).

=== Fragmentation



==== FRAG and FRAG2

FRAG and FRAG2 fragment large messages into smaller ones, send the smaller ones, and at the receiver
                side, the smaller fragments will get assembled into larger messages again, and delivered to the
                application. FRAG and FRAG2 work for both unicast and multicast messages.
            

The difference between FRAG and FRAG2 is that FRAG2 does 1 less copy than FRAG, so it is the recommended
                fragmentation protocol. FRAG serializes a message to know the exact size required (including headers),
                whereas FRAG2 only fragments the payload (excluding the headers), so it is faster.
            

The properties of FRAG2 are:
            

${FRAG2}

Contrary to FRAG, FRAG2 does not need to serialize a message in order to break it into smaller
                fragments: it looks only at the message's buffer, which is a byte array anyway. We assume that the
                size addition for headers and src and dest addresses is minimal when the transport finally has to
                serialize the message, so we add a constant (by default 200 bytes). Because of the efficiency gained by
                not having to serialize the message just to determine its size, FRAG2 is generally recommended over FRAG.
            



=== Ordering

[[SEQUENCER]]


==== SEQUENCER

SEQUENCER provider total order for multicast (=group) messages by forwarding messages to the current
                coordinator, which then sends the messages to the cluster on behalf of the original sender. Because it
                is always the same sender (whose messages are delivered in FIFO order), a global (or total) order
                is established.
            

Sending members add every forwarded message M to a buffer and remove M when they receive it. Should
                the current coordinator crash, all buffered messages are forwarded to the new coordinator.
            

${SEQUENCER}

[[TOA]]


==== Total Order Anycast (TOA)

A total order anycast is a totally ordered message sent to a subset of the cluster members. TOA
                intercepts messages with an AnycastMessage (carrying a list of addresses) and handles sending of the
                message in total order. Say the cluster is {A,B,C,D,E} and the Anycast is to {B,C}.
            

Skeen's algorithm is used to send the message: B and C each maintain a logical clock (a counter).
                When a message is to be sent, TOA contacts B and C and asks them for their counters. B and C return
                their counters (incrementing them for the next request).
            

The originator of the message then sets the message's ID to be the max of all returned counters and
                sends the message. Receivers then deliver the messages in order of their IDs.
            

The main use of TOA is currently in Infinispan's transactional caches with partial replication: it
                is used to apply transactional modifications in total order, so that no two-phase commit protocol
                has to be run and no locks have to be acquired.
            

As shown in link:$$http://www.cloudtm.eu/home/Publications$$[ "Exploiting Total Order Multicast in Weakly Consistent Transactional Caches"], when we have
                many conflicts by different transactions modifying the same keys, TOM fares better than 2PC.
            

Note that TOA is experimental (as of 3.1).

[[StateTransferProtocolDetails]]


=== State Transfer

[[pbcast.STATE_TRANSFER]]


==== pbcast.STATE_TRANSFER

STATE_TRANSFER is the existing transfer protocol, which transfers byte[] buffers around. However, at the
                state provider's side, JGroups creates an output stream over the byte[] buffer, and passes the
                ouput stream to the getState(OutputStream) callback, and at the state
                requester's side, an input stream is created and passed to the
                setState(InputStream) callback.
            

This allows us to continue using STATE_TRANSFER, until the new state transfer protocols are going to
                replace it (perhaps in 4.0).
            

In order to transfer application state to a joining member of a cluster, STATE_TRANSFER has to load
                entire state into memory and send it to a joining member. The major limitation of this approach is that
                for state transfers that are very large this would likely result in memory exhaustion.
            

For large state transfer use either the STATE or STATE_SOCK protocol. However, if the state is small,
                STATE_TRANSFER is okay.
            

${STATE_TRANSFER}

[[StreamingStateTransfer]]


==== StreamingStateTransfer

StreamingStateTransfer is the superclass of STATE and STATE_SOCK (see below).
                Its properties are:
            

${StreamingStateTransfer}

[[pbcast.STATE]]


==== pbcast.STATE



===== Overview

STATE was renamed from (2.x) STREAMING_STATE_TRANSFER, and refactored to extend a common superclass
                    StreamingStateTransfer. The other state transfer protocol extending
                    StreamingStateTransfer is STATE_SOCK (see <<STATE_SOCK>>).
                

STATE uses a _streaming approach_ to state transfer; the
                    state provider writes its state to the output stream passed to it in the
                    getState(OutputStream) callback, which chunks the stream up into chunks
                    that are sent to the state requester in separate messages.
                

The state requester receives those chunks and feeds them into the input stream from which the
                    state is read by the setState(InputStream) callback.
                

The advantage compared to STATE_TRANSFER is that state provider and requester only need small
                    (transfer) buffers to keep a part of the state in memory, whereas STATE_TRANSFER needs to copy
                    the _entire_ state into memory.
                

If we for example have a list of 1 million elements, then STATE_TRANSFER would have to create a
                    byte[] buffer out of it, and return the byte[] buffer, whereas a streaming approach could iterate
                    through the list and write each list element to the output stream. Whenever the buffer capacity is
                    reached, we'd then send a message and the buffer would be reused to receive more data.
                



===== Configuration

STATE has currently no properties other than those inherited by
                    StreamingStateTransfer (see above).
                

[[pbcast.STATE_SOCK]]


==== STATE_SOCK

STATE_SOCK is also a streaming state transfer protocol, but compared to STATE, it doesn't send the chunks
                as messages, but uses a TCP socket connection between state provider and requester to transfer the state.
            

The state provider creates a server socket at a configurable bind address and port, and the address
                and port are sent back to a state requester in the state response. The state requester then establishes
                a socket connection to the server socket and passes the socket's input stream to the
                setState(InputStream) callback.
            



===== Configuration

The configuration options of STATE_SOCK are listed below:
                

${STATE_SOCK}

[[BARRIER]]


==== BARRIER

BARRIER is used by some of the state transfer protocols, as it lets existing threads complete and blocks
                new threads to get both the digest and state in one go.
            

In 3.1, a new mechanism for state transfer will be implemented, eliminating the need for BARRIER. Until
                then, BARRIER should be used when one of the state transfer protocols is used. BARRIER is
                part of every default stack which contains a state transfer protocol.
            

${BARRIER}



=== pbcast.FLUSH

Flushing forces group members to send all their pending messages
            prior to a certain event. The process of flushing acquiesces the
            cluster so that state transfer or a join can be done. It is also
            called the stop-the-world model as nobody will be able to send
            messages while a flush is in process. Flush is used in:
        


State transfer:: When a member requests state transfer, it tells everyone to
                   stop sending messages and waits for everyone's ack. Then it have received everyone's asks,
                   the application asks the coordinator for its state and ships it back to the
                   requester. After the requester has received and set the state
                   successfully, the requester tells everyone to resume sending messages.
View changes (e.g.a join):: Before installing a new view
                        V2, flushing ensures that all messages _sent_ in the
                        current view V1 are indeed _delivered_ in V1, rather than in V2
                        (in all non-faulty members). This is essentially Virtual Synchrony.
                    


                
        

FLUSH is designed as another protocol positioned just below the
            channel, on top of the stack (e.g. above STATE_TRANSFER). The STATE_TRANSFER and GMS
            protocols request a flush by sending an event up the stack, where
            it is handled by the FLUSH protcol. Another event is sent back by
            the FLUSH protocol to let the caller know that the flush has completed.
            When done (e.g. view was installed or state transferred), the protocol
            sends a message, which will allow everyone in the cluster to resume sending.
        

A channel is notified that the FLUSH phase has been started by
            the Receiver.block() callback.

[[STATS]]


==== Statistics

STATS exposes various statistics, e.g. number of received multicast and unicast messages, number of
                bytes sent etc. It should be placed directly over the transport
            

${STATS}

[[Security]]


==== Security

JGroups provides protocols to encrypt cluster traffic (ENCRYPT), and to make sure that only
                authorized members can join a cluster (AUTH and SASL).
            

[[ENCRYPT]]


===== ENCRYPT

A detailed description of ENCRYPT is found in the JGroups source (__JGroups/doc/ENCRYPT.html__).
Encryption by default only encrypts the message body, but doesn't encrypt message headers.
To encrypt the entire message (including all headers, plus destination and source addresses),
the property ++$$encrypt_entire_message$$++ has to be set to true.
Also, ENCRYPT has to be below any protocols whose headers we want to encrypt, e.g.


[source,xml]
----
<config ... >
    <UDP />
    <PING />
    <MERGE2 />
    <FD />
    <VERIFY_SUSPECT />
    <pbcast.NAKACK />
    <UNICAST />
    <pbcast.STABLE />
    <FRAG2 />
    <pbcast.GMS />
    <ENCRYPT encrypt_entire_message="false"
             sym_init="128" sym_algorithm="AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"
             asym_init="512" asym_algorithm="RSA"/>
</config>
----

Note that ENCRYPT sits below NAKACK and UNICAST, so the sequence numbers for these 2 protocols will
                    be encrypted. Had ENCRYPT been placed below UNICAST but above NAKACK, then only UNICAST's headers
                    (including sequence numbers) would have been encrypted, but not NAKACKs.
                

Note that it doesn't make too much sense to place ENCRYPT even lower in the stack, because then
                    almost all traffic (even merge or discovery traffic) will be encrypted, which may be somewhat of
                    a performance drag.
                    

When we encrypt an entire message, we have to marshal the message into a byte buffer first and
                    then encrypt it. This entails marshalling and copying of the byte buffer, which is not so good
                    performance wise...
                



.Using a key store
ENCRYPT uses store type JCEKS (for details between JKS and JCEKS see here), however
                        +keytool+ uses JKS, therefore a keystore generated with keytool will not be accessible.
                    

To generate a keystore compatible with JCEKS, use the following command line options to keytool:
                    


----

keytool -genseckey -alias myKey -keypass changeit -storepass changeit  -keyalg Blowfish -keysize 56 -keystore defaultStore.keystore -storetype  JCEKS
                    
----

ENCRYPT could then be configured as follows:
                    


[source,xml]
----

<ENCRYPT key_store_name="defaultStore.keystore"
         store_password="changeit"
         alias="myKey"/>
                    
----

Note that defaultStore.keystore will have to be found in the claspath.
                    


NOTE: If asymmetric encryption is used (no shared key via keystore), ENCRYPT has to be placed somewhere _above_ GMS,
      or else the JOIN process would not function (as the JOIN response would get dropped).

${ENCRYPT}

[[AUTH]]


===== AUTH

AUTH is used to provide a layer of authentication to JGroups.  This allows you to define pluggable
                    security that defines if a node should be allowed to join a cluster.  AUTH sits below the GMS
                    protocol and listens for JOIN REQUEST messages.  When a JOIN REQUEST is received it tries to find
                    an AuthHeader object, inside of which should be an implementation of the AuthToken object.
                

AuthToken is an abstract class, implementations of which are responsible for providing the
                    actual authentication mechanism.  Some basic implementations of AuthToken are provide in the
                    org.jgroups.auth package (SimpleToken, MD5Token and X509Token).  Effectivly all these implementations
                    do is encrypt a string (found in the jgroups config) and pass that on the JOIN REQUEST.
                

When authentication is successful, the message is simply passed up the stack to the GMS protocol.
                    When it fails, the AUTH protocol creates a JOIN RESPONSE message with a failure string and passes
                    it back down the stack.  This failure string informs the client of the reason for failure.
                    Clients will then fail to join the group and will throw a SecurityException.
                    If this error string is null then authentication is considered to have passed.
                

For more information refer to the wiki at http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JGroupsAUTH[AUTH].
                

${AUTH}

[[SASL]]


===== SASL

SASL is an alternative to the AUTH protocol which provides a layer of authentication to JGroups by allowing the
                    use of one of the SASL mechanisms made available by the JDK. SASL sits below the GMS
                    protocol and listens for JOIN / MERGE REQUEST messages.  When a JOIN / MERGE REQUEST is received it tries to find
                    a SaslHeader object which contains the initial response required by the chosen SASL mech. This initiates a sequence
                    of challenge/response messages which, if successful, culminates in allowing the new node to join the cluster. The actual
                    validation logic required by the SASL mech must be provided by the user in the form of a standard javax.security.auth.CallbackHandler
                    implementation.
                

When authentication is successful, the message is simply passed up the stack to the GMS protocol.
                    When it fails, the SASL protocol creates a JOIN / MERGE RESPONSE message with a failure string and passes
                    it back down the stack.  This failure string informs the client of the reason for failure.
                    Clients will then fail to join the group and will throw a SecurityException.
                    If this error string is null then authentication is considered to have passed.
                

SASL can be (minimally) configured as follows:
                


[source,xml]
----

<config ... >
    <UDP />
    <PING />
    <pbcast.NAKACK />
    <UNICAST3 />
    <pbcast.STABLE />
    <SASL mech="DIGEST-MD5" 
        client_callback_handler="org.example.ClientCallbackHandler" 
        server_callback_handler="org.example.ServerCallbackHandler"/>
    <pbcast.GMS />
    
</config>
                
----

The +mech+ property specifies the SASL mech you want to use, as defined by RFC-4422. You will also need to provide two
                    callback handlers, one used when the node is running as coordinator (++$$server_callback_handler$$++) and one used in all other 
                    cases (++$$client_callback_handler$$++). Refer to the JDK's SASL reference guide for more details: link:$$http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/sasl/sasl-refguide.html$$[] 
                
The JGroups package comes with a simple properties-based CallbackHandler which can be used when a more complex Kerberos/LDAP approach is not needed. To use this set both the (++$$server_callback_handler$$++) and
                    the (++$$client_callback_handler$$++) to org.jgroups.auth.sasl.SimpleAuthorizingCallbackHandler. This CallbackHandler can be configured either programmatically by passing to the constructor an
                    instance of java.util.Properties containing the appropriate properties, or via standard Java system properties (i.e. set on the command-line using the -DpropertyName=propertyValue notation.
                    The following properties are available:

* sasl.credentials.properties - the path to a property file which contains principal/credential mappings represented as principal=password
* sasl.local.principal - the name of the principal that is used to identify the local node. It must exist in the sasl.credentials.properties file
* sasl.roles.properties - (optional) the path to a property file which contains principal/roles mappings represented as principal=role1,role2,role3
* sasl.role - (optional) if present, authorizes joining nodes only if their principal is
* sasl.realm - (optional) the name of the realm to use for the SASL mechanisms that require it

[[COMPRESS]]


==== COMPRESS

COMPRESS compresses messages larger than +$$min_size$$+, and uncompresses them at the
                receiver's side. Property +$$compression_level$$+ determines how thorough the
                compression algorith should be (0: no compression, 9: highest compression).
            

${COMPRESS}

[[SCOPE]]


==== SCOPE

As discussed in <<Scopes>>, the SCOPE protocol is used to deliver updates
                to different scopes concurrently. It has to be placed somewhere above UNICAST and NAKACK.
            

SCOPE has a separate thread pool. The reason why the default thread pool from the transport wasn't used
                is that the default thread pool has a different purpose. For example, it can use a queue to which all
                incoming messages are added, which would defy the purpose of concurrent delivery in SCOPE. As a matter
                of fact, using a queue would most likely delay messages get sent up into SCOPE!
            

Also, the default pool's rejection policy might not be "run", so the SCOPE implementation would have
                to catch rejection exceptions and engage in a retry protocol, which is complex and wastes resources.
            

The configuration of the thread pool is shown below. If you expect _concurrent_
                messages to N _different_ scopes, then the max pool size would ideally be set
                to N. However, in most cases, this is not necessary as (a) the messages might not be to different
                scopes or (b) not all N scopes might get messages at the same time. So even if the max pool size is a
                bit smaller, the cost of this is slight delays, in the sense that a message for scope Y might wait until
                the thread processing message for scope X is available.
            

To remove unused scopes, an expiry policy is provided: expiration_time is the number of milliseconds
                after which an idle scope is removed. An idle scope is a scope which hasn't seen any messages for
                expiration_time milliseconds. The expiration_interval value defines the number of milliseconds at
                which the expiry task runs. Setting both values to 0 disables expiration; it would then have to be
                done manually (see <<Scopes>> for details).

==== RATE_LIMITER

RATE_LIMITER can be used to set a limit on the data sent per time unit. When sending data, only
                max_bytes can be sent per time_period milliseconds. E.g. if max_bytes="50M" and time_period="1000", then
                a sender can only send 50MBytes / sec max.
            

${RATE_LIMITER}

[[LockingProtocols]]
==== Locking protocols

There are currently 2 locking protocols: org.jgroups.protocols.CENTRAL_LOCK and
                org.jgroups.protocols.PEER_LOCK. Both extend Locking, which has the
                following properties:
            

${Locking}

[[CENTRAL_LOCK]]


===== CENTRAL_LOCK

CENTRAL_LOCK has the current coordinator of a cluster grants locks, so every node has to communicate
                    with the coordinator to acquire or release a lock. Lock requests by different nodes for the same lock
                    are processed in the order in which they are received.
                

A coordinator maintains a lock table. To prevent losing the knowledge of who holds which locks, the
                    coordinator can push lock information to a number of backups defined by num_backups. If num_backups
                    is 0, no replication of lock information happens. If num_backups is greater than 0, then the coordinator
                    pushes information about acquired and released locks to all backup nodes. Topology changes might
                    create new backup nodes, and lock information is pushed to those on becoming a new backup node.
                

The advantage of CENTRAL_LOCK is that all lock requests are granted in the same order across
                    the cluster, which is not the case with PEER_LOCK.
                

${CENTRAL_LOCK}

[[PEER_LOCK]]


===== PEER_LOCK

PEER_LOCK acquires a lock by contacting all cluster nodes, and lock acquisition is only successful
                    if all non-faulty cluster nodes (peers) grant it.
                

Unless a total order configuration is used (e.g. org.jgroups.protocols.SEQUENCER based), lock
                    requests for the same resource from different senders may be received in different order, so
                    deadlocks can occur. Example:
                   
* Nodes A and B
* A and B call lock(X) at the same time
* A receives L(X,A) followed by L(X,B): locks X(A), queues L(X,B)
* B receives L(X,B) followed by L(X,A): locks X(B), queues L(X,A)
                

To acquire a lock, we need lock grants from both A and B, but this will never happen here.
                    To fix this, either add SEQUENCER to the configuration, so that all lock requests are received in
                    the same global order at both A and B, or use
                    java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock.tryLock(long,javaTimeUnit) with retries if a lock cannot be acquired.

[[SUPERVISOR]]


==== SUPERVISOR

SUPERVISOR is a protocol which runs rules which periodically (or event triggered) check conditions and
                take corrective action if a condition is not met. Example: org.jgroups.protocols.rules.CheckFDMonitor is
                a rule which periodically checks if FD's monitor task is running when the cluster size is &gt; 1. If not,
                the monitor task is started.
            

The SUPERVISOR is explained in more detail in <<Supervisor>>

[[FORK]]


==== FORK

FORK allows ForkChannels to piggy-back messages on a regular channel. Needs to be placed towards the
                top of the stack. See <<ForkChannel>> for details.
