New features
============



TCP_NIO2: new non-blocking transport based on NIO.2
---------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-886]

This new transport is based on NIO.2 and *non-blocking*, ie. no reads or writes will ever block. The biggest
advantage compared to TCP is that we moved from the 1-thread-per-connection model to the 1-selector-for-all-connections
model. This means that we use 1 thread for N connections in TCP_NIO2, while TCP used N threads.
To use this, new classes TcpClient / NioClient and TcpServer / NioServer have been created.
More details at http://belaban.blogspot.ch/2015/07/a-new-nio.html.


Fork channels now support state transfer
----------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1941]

Fork channels used to throw an exception on calling ForkChannel.getState(). This is now supported; details in the
JIRA issue.


GossipRouter has been reimplemented using the NIO
-------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1943]

GossipRouter can now use a blocking (TcpServer) or a non-blocking (NioServer) implementation. On the client side,
RouterStub (TUNNEL and TCPGOSSIP) can do the same, using TcpClient or NioClient.
Which implementation is used is governed by the -nio flag when starting the router, or in the configuration of
TUNNEL / TCPGOSSIP (use_nio).
Blocking clients can interact with a non-blocking GossipRouter, and vice versa.



Optimizations
=============




Bug fixes
=========

Retransmissions use the INTERNAL flag
-------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1940]

Retransmissions use the internal flag: when a retransmission is a request, a potential response was also flagged as
internal. This flag is now cleared on reception of a request.



Lock.tryLock() can wait forever
-------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1949]

Caused by a conversion from nanos to millis.


TCPPING: access initial_hosts in the defined order
--------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1959]

Was not the case as we used a HashSet which reordered elements.
