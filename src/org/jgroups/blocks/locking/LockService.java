/**
 * LockService is the main class for to use for distributed locking functionality. LockService needs access to a
 * {@link JChannel} and interacts with a locking protocol (e.g. {@link org.jgroups.protocols.CENTRAL_LOCK}) via events.<p>
 * When no locking protocol is seen on the channel's stack, LockService will throw an exception at startup. An example
 * of using LockService is:
 * <pre>
   JChannel ch=new JChannel("/home/bela/locking.xml); // locking.xml needs to have a locking protocol towards the top
   LockService lock_service=new LockService(ch);
   ch.connect("lock-cluster");
   Lock lock=lock_service.getLock("mylock");
   lock.lock();
   try {
      // do something with the lock acquired
   }
   finally {
      lock.unlock();
   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The exact semantics of this lock implemantation are defined in {@link LockImpl}.
 * <p>
 * Note that, contrary to the semantics of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}, unlock() can be called multiple
 * times; after a lock has been released, future calls to unlock() have no effect.
