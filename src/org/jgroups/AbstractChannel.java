/**
 * A channel represents a group communication endpoint (like BSD datagram sockets). A client joins a
 * group by connecting the channel to a group and leaves it by disconnecting. Messages sent over the
 * channel are received by all group members that are connected to the same group (that is, all
 * members that have the same group name).
 * <p/>
 * 
 * The FSM for a channel is roughly as follows: a channel is created (<em>unconnected</em>). The
 * channel is connected to a group (<em>connected</em>). Messages can now be sent and received. The
 * channel is disconnected from the group (<em>unconnected</em>). The channel could now be connected
 * to a different group again. The channel is closed (<em>closed</em>).
 * <p/>
 * 
 * Only a single sender is allowed to be connected to a channel at a time, but there can be more
 * than one channel in an application.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * Messages can be sent to the group members using the <em>send</em> method and messages can be
 * received setting a {@link Receiver} in {@link #setReceiver(Receiver)} and implementing the
 * {@link Receiver#receive(Message)} callback.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A channel instance is created using the public constructor.
 * <p/>
 * Various degrees of sophistication in message exchange can be achieved using building blocks on
 * top of channels; e.g., light-weight groups, synchronous message invocation, or remote method
 * calls. Channels are on the same abstraction level as sockets, and should really be simple to use.
 * Higher-level abstractions are all built on top of channels.
