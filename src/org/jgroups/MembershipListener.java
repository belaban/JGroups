 * Allows a listener to be notified when group membership changes.

 * The MembershipListener interface is similar to the {@link MessageListener} interface: every time
 * a new view, a suspicion message, or a block event is received, the corresponding method of the
 * class implementing MembershipListener will be called. MembershipListener is often used in JGroups
 * building blocks installed on top of a channel i.e RpcDispatcher and MessageDispatcher. Oftentimes
 * the only method containing any functionality will be viewAccepted() which notifies the receiver
 * that a new member has joined the group or that an existing member has left or crashed.
